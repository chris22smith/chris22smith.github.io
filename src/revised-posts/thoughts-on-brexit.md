Now that the dust has settled a bit and we get the odd day without a massive news story on Britain leaving the EU I thought I'd put some of my thoughts down.

First up, I voted to remain in the EU. I had 2 main reasons for voting this way. Firstly, I'm half English, half French so just kind of feel like a European citizen. I've got family both sides of the water and anything which brings all of that closer together just generally feels like a good thing to me. My second reason, and actually the stronger reason, was the very simple "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" idea. I was happy enough with everything as it was so why change anything?

Before the election I never imagined that Britain would actually vote to leave but I always felt that even if they did it wouldn't actually make much difference to me on a day-to-day basis. In the EU or out of the EU Britain would still be trading with other countries in and out of Europe and would still have foreign policies, immigration policies, etc.

When the referendum result was announced I felt a real sense of shock and a degree of fear over what might happen. The pound took a nosedive and many started to wonder if the economy would be sent into a downward spiral. Would Britain be the next Greece, only without any possibility of any EU bailout?

I think the thing that bothered me most was not the result but the reasons behind a lot of the votes. In a word, hate. A lot of people seemed to vote to leave as a protest against immigration.

It's always a difficult issue but there are different ways of looking at it. Maybe if there was a large community of foreigners living next to me I might start feeling uncomfortable about it. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong in that. A certain level of xenophobia is in our nature and I don't think there's any point in trying to shy away from that. Its easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't affect you.

Putting the boot on the other foot, imagine you're running a small business. It's tough. Most fold in the first year. Imagine trying to employ people. Again, tough. Now, you can either recruit from your local area, or from the whole of Europe. Which one of those pools is going to give you the better selection of candidates, and therefore the best employees? It's a no-brainer. By getting the best people in jobs, businesses grow and the economy grows.
