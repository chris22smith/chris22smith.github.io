<img class="alignright" style="float: right;border: 0;margin: 20px" src="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/dice1.jpg" alt="Taking a chance?" width="200" height="100" />I often get invited to quote for <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">designing ecommerce sites</a> or <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">online stores</a> and more often than not I actually decline the invitation. I don't feel it's morally right to invest my time and a customer's money in something that is doomed to failure.

It's not that people have bad ideas, it's just that they don't have a business plan. I think most of us know that most new businesses fail in their first year and online businesses are no different. All too often people see having a website as the answer when it's only part of a larger process. I get the feeling that people still believe that they can spend money on a <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">new website</a> and then sit back and wait for the orders to come in.

Whilst having your own <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">ecommerce site</a> or <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">online business</a> is appealing it is a big initial investment for a new business and you should consider how many sales you'd need to cover the cost. If you can't be sure that you can recover this cost within a reasonable timescale you shouldn't take the risk.

There are other ways. I often advise people starting out on a new venture to start off selling through <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk" target="_blank">eBay</a>. You pay a nominal amount to list your products and have to give eBay a percentage of your revenue but this is a lot cheaper and less risky than shelling out for a website. After a time, if you feel that there is a proven market and that you can make a profit then you can look at running your own site. Hopefully, if things have gone well, you'll have a bit of money in the bank to invest too.
