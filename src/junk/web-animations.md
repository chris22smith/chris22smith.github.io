<h3>Zooming</h3>
By zooming all I really mean is moving things nearer or further by animating them along the Z axis with transform:translateZ(). I like to set the opacity at 1 when they're close up and fade them down to a lower opacity as they're further away. This gives a very natural feeling of coming into focus or if exaggerated can give the impression of something emerging from a fog.
