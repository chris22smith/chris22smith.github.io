As a <a title="web developer" href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com" target="_self">web developer</a> and <a title="programmer" href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com" target="_self">programmer</a> I'm always on the look out for solutions to little problems. How do I do that? How can I make that do this without X, Y and Z happening? You get the idea.

My first port of call is always <a title="Google" href="https://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a>. The way I see it is that I'm unikely to ever have a technical requirement that somebody else hasn't had before. In fact, it's highly likely that hundreds, even thousands of people have faced the same challenges. By using the right search terms on <a title="Google" href="https://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a> I can usually find the answers to my problems. This inspired me to build a <a title="technical blog" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">technical blog</a>. It's my way of sharing what I've learnt and, hopefully, helping someone else out.

As well as trying to help others it's also tremendously useful to me. Every time I overcome an obstacle I write about it and provide the solution giving <a title="code examples" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">code examples</a> where I can. It's very handy to just be able to just come back to it rather than try to remember things that I've done in the past. I also use the site for setting up links to <a title="web development resources" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">resources</a> I like and use. Again, it just saves me time looking for things.

My site is called <a title="Dinowebs" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">Dinowebs</a>, <a title="Dinowebs" href="https://dinowebs.net">https://dinowebs.net</a>. The site covers all sorts of <a title="coding" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">coding</a> and <a title="web development" href="https://dinowebs.net" target="_self">web development</a> subject matter. Please take a look.
