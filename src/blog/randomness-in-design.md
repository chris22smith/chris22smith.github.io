I've created a few pens on <a href="http://codepen.io" target="_blank">Codepen</a> recently which involve JavaScript generating random elements in the DOM. Add a new element and assign it random position, dimensions or scale.

<a href="http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/WrzVxw" target="_blank">Random Circles</a>

Whilst these were just playing around, I am interested by the idea of bringing an element of randomness into designs. There's a real feeling of the natural world in allowing things to be created and move around of their own accord or, at least, appear to.
