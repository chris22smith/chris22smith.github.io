I hate seeing "click here". Uuurgh! It's such a 1995 way of thinking about web pages. There's always a better way.

A typical example might be "To create your account please click here." Why not simply "Create your account"? It's obvious, it's shorter and the link text actually means something which is better for accessibility and search engine optimisation.

The other part that annoys me is that a click isn't really a click any more. It could be a tap on a touch screen, you might be tabbing through the interactive page elements with a keyboard, using a screen reader or any number of other devices which don't use a click.

If you see it, please have a word. :)
