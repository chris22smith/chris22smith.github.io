<p>I was curious as to what value I was getting out of following people in the tech industry on Twitter. Are they sharing useful information or just sharing pictures of their pets? Is it jokes and memes, self-promotion, sharing useful resources, praise, criticism, politics? I studied <strong>100</strong> consecutive tweets to get an idea.</p>
<p>This is by knows means scientific but still quite interesting. There are a few important parameters for how I use Twitter, which may explain differences from what you see. Firstly, I don't exclusively follow people in tech. I follow real world friends, football journalists, comedians, celebrities - a pretty broad spectrum of people. Here I've limited the tweets analysed to just those from people in tech. I've got to admit there were one or two where I wasn't sure so had to check their bios. Secondly, I try to follow real people, not faceless organisations. My rationale is that organisations' tweets are 99% self-promotion. If their content is good enough I'll get to hear about it via others retweeting. I'm trusting the people I follow to filter the organisational information I receive. Final point is I have a couple of words muted - "Trump" and "Brexit". This will obviously impact on the amount of political tweets I see.</p>

<p>So, here's a breakdown from <strong>100</strong> tweets on Friday 26th April, roughly 5.00 - 5.30pm UK time. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>68%</strong> were tech-related<br><strong>29%</strong> were not tech-related<br><strong>3%</strong> I couldn't be sure about</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>6%</strong> I could not understand, tech or otherwise</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the <strong>68</strong> tech related tweets,<br><strong>48 (71%)</strong> were aiming to share something useful<br>(retweets, links to resources, media)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of the <strong>29 </strong>tweets not related to tech, subjects/themes were:<br><strong>4</strong> Gender Inequality * <br><strong>2</strong> Humorous (jokes/memes) <br><strong>2</strong> Politics **<br><strong>2</strong> Cats<br><strong>1</strong> Dog<br><strong>1</strong> Goats<br><strong>1</strong> Game of Thrones<br><strong>1</strong> Mental Health ***</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>* It could be argued that these are tech related if the people tweeting are in the tech industry but it wasn't mentioned explicitly. Either way 4% or 1/25 tweets is very prominent.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>** This is despite my "Trump" and "Brexit" muted words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*** Big thumbs up!</p>

<p>If anyone else would like to do the same exercise it would be interesting to compare and contrast results.</p>
