When designing a website an important consideration is its usability and, in particular, the site's visitors being able to understand how to use the site instantly without having to think about it. It should be obvious where to find the login link, the search box, know which text is hyperlinked without having to hover over it, etc.

The easiest way to design for people is to give them more of what they already know and understand. Let's take a look at the most popular sites in the UK and see how they do things. We'll look at where various page elements are positioned and how links are styled. This list comes from <a title="alexa.com" href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/GB" target="_blank">Alexa's Top Sites in the United Kingdom</a>.

<strong>The consensus</strong>

From looking at these popular sites we can see these common conventions:

logo position - usually top left corner
login position - usually top right corner
search box position - always at the top, usually central
corporate info position - always found in the page's footer
search filters or options position - either running horizontally across the top or down the left side
ads position - in the right column, after the main content
links - usually blue or dark blue, sometimes underlined, more commonly not but underlined on hover

Consciously or not, this is what people are used to seeing on the web so this is what you should follow. Web users will instinctively look for these page elements in these locations and understand links in these colour schemes. Any deviation from "the norm" will increase the chances of uncertainty or confusion.
