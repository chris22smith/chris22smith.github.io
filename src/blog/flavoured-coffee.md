For Christmas I received a selection pack of syrups for coffee. You know the ones, <em>Le Sirop de MONIN</em>. Very nice. There are various flavours - vanilla, caramel, hazelnut, gingerbread and chocolate cookie. I've started putting a dash in my coffee every day and they're a nice enhancement to my drink.

Only, I've realised something. You can't really taste the flavour. All you really taste is the sweetness from the sugar. So, I checked the bottles and, as suspected, they're mostly water and sugar with a tiny amount of extract of something else.Â You can't actually tell the different flavours apart unless you add loads of the stuff, like proper big measures. So, when it comes down to it, I'm now taking sugar in my coffee when I wasn't before, which probably isn't good.
