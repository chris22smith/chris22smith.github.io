Web Design, Development and UX

<hr />

<h2>HTML5</h2>
I pride myself on writing clean, semantic and accessible HTML including ARIA attributes.
<h3>HTML Email</h3>
HTML email is a highly specialised skill. After completing a CodeSchool course I've created several templates which have gone into production.

<hr />

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
I tend to write <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong> whenever possible as it's compatible with any framework and as frameworks come and go remains constant. I've recently learned parts of <strong>ES2015</strong> and use <strong>TypeScript</strong> to make JavaScript type safe.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h3>JavaScript Frameworks and Tools</h3>
The list of frameworks, libraries and tools gets longer all the time. Day to day I work with <strong>Angular</strong> (1). I've known <strong>jQuery</strong> for a long time including the <strong>jQuery UI</strong> front end framework for things like datepickers, autocomplete, sortable lists, drag and drop. I've done projects using <strong>Knockout</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.

&nbsp;

Other JavaScript based tools I've worked with include <strong>Google Maps API</strong>, <strong>Google Charts API</strong>, <strong>Charts.js</strong>, <strong>Dragula </strong>(drag and drop), <strong>Moment.js </strong>(date/time), <strong>Hopscotch</strong> (inline help), <strong>Toastr</strong> (notifications), <strong>Elevate Zoom</strong> (image zooming).

<hr />

<h2>CSS</h2>
I've used CSS for a long time, moving towards the preprocessor <strong>Sass</strong> (SCSS) in more recent years.
<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
I've worked with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> on several projects as well as one using Google's <strong>Material</strong>.

<hr />

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
I use a tool called aXe which validates HTML and CSS against WCAG standards. It can be used as a browser extension or as a Visual Studio extension providing warnings of any accessibility violations.

<hr />

<h2>Media</h2>
I regularly use different fonts, mainly from <strong>Google Fonts</strong> and make heavy use of <strong>Font Awesome</strong> icon font, although the latest version has moved to SVG.

I've learned <strong>SVG</strong> and use it wherever possible to give sharp looking graphics at any resolution. I use <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> to work with SVG and export graphics in different formats and resolutions.

<hr />

&nbsp;
<h2>Code Editors</h2>
My main tool is <strong>Visual Studio</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Team Foundation Server</strong> and I use both <strong>Source Control</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>. I tend to do a lot of front end work in <strong>CodePen</strong> as it allows for quick editing, forking and sharing of front end code.

<hr />

<h2>Testing</h2>
I've done a limited amount of <strong>unit testing</strong> using <strong>Jasmine</strong> and <strong>Karma</strong>. I regularly test web content <strong>cross browser</strong> using <strong>BrowserStack</strong>.
