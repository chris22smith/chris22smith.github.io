<p>Sometimes I see stuff on web pages and wonder how the developers ever thought that was OKâ€¦</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>"Please make sure you click on this button only once or you may be charged twice."</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>We're server side guys. We don't really do front end. We don't know how to disable the button when it's clicked to prevent this so we'll just warn you not to click it. Yeah, that'll be fine.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>"Please contact your system administrator."</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Dunno. Your bad, not ours. You figure it out. We're washing our hands of this whole thing.</p>
