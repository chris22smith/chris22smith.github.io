<a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> keeps hitting the headlines at the moment but a lot of people don't seem to understand what it really is and how it differs from other Social Networks. I'll try to explain it in terms more people can understand.

<a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is basically about posting short messages, much like SMS texting on mobiles. Each post is called a "tweet" and is limited to 140 characters. It can't include other media as such but it can include hyperlinks so anything you wish to share is only a click away.

It doesn't work like email where you choose the recipients of your messages but more like a subscription service. You put your message out there and it's read by your subscribers. In many ways it's more like broadcasting.

As a <a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> user, or "Twitterer", you have the option to "follow" other users meaning you subscribe to their broadcasts. Each user has lists of "following" - who he/she has chosen to follow and "followers" - who is following him/her.

<a title="Twitter" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> has 2 real strengths which differentiate it from other networks.

Firstly, the 140 characters limit means it is highly portable and works well with mobile phone applications. For example, it's very easy to let your followers know what you're doing whilst on the move.

Secondly, when you read someone else's "tweet" there's a facility to "retweet" it, which means instantly broadcasting it to all of your followers. This means that something written by one person can reach millions within a very short time frame. This is what tends to happen with big breaking news stories and this is why it is becoming such a powerful tool for <a title="Internet Marketing" href="https://www.chrissmithmarketing.com" target="_self">marketing</a> and PR.
