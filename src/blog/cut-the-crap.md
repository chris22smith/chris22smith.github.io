We all write loads of crap. All of us. Every day. It's time to stop. Think it through and cut it out.

I'm not so much talking about what we say but more the way we say it. We use stupidly over-complicated, flowery, pompous language to express very simple ideas. We should all just keep it clear and simple. The <a href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/" target="_blank">Campaign for Plain English</a> has loads of great examplesÂ of ways we can replace the fancy words with simple ones. A few examples:

<ul>
 	<li>adjacent <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> next to</li>
 	<li>amendment <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> change</li>
 	<li>comprises <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> includes</li>
 	<li>demonstrate <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> show</li>
 	<li>discontinue <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> stop</li>
</ul>
Removing the pretentious vocabulary also makes our writing much easier to understand for people who don't have English as their first language. It's all positive with no negatives.

Let's just keep it simple and cut the crap.
