I spend a lot of time in the car, travelling to and from work. I get easily irritated by the radio and bored of listening to the same music so spoken word podcasts work well for me. It means a bit of organisation and planning but I now enjoy my journeys. I listen to various different genres of podcast. Here are my current favourites in the comedy genre.

Rhod is also joined by a co-host, usually another stand-up comedian. The co-host makes a big difference to the show. Some work brilliantly well with Rhod; others make it feel a bit laboured but Rhod is always on good form. Shows featuring Lloyd Langford orÂ Chris Corcoran are particularly great.
