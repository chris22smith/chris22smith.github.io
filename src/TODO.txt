Been through /posts
  junk (drafts, image refs, etc.) moved to /junk
  posts that have imported moved to /blog
  posts that created an empty file moved to /empty-posts

Make copy of json
Go through json, removing junk and imported posts to leave those that failed to imported
Examine json looking for reasons for import failure and fix issues
Retry import to /posts

suspect it's revisions causing issues
split json into wp-posts and wp-revisions
removing all but most recent revision (last item)

problem not with revisions but maybe post content

create small json file with 3 problem posts
try fixing content issues and reimport

still problems with:

fantasy-football-best-season-yet
what-i-learned-in-2014 (parts 1-3)
lazy-html
performance-perception-trick
pet-hate

problems were with punctuation in title
used post.post_name instead of slugifying post.post_title


sort out tags on on blog posts, tech or misc, maybe best
got as far as measuring-readership (todo)
look into ordering collections by date and multiple tags
