    <p>Today, 1st Feb, is International box-sizing Awareness Day, apparently. Add it to your calendar now! :) I'm not sure how official that is, or who decided it but it's good to have an annual reminder on some things.</p>
<p>The general consensus in early 2017 seems to be that the boffins got the spec wrong on this one and border-box should have been the default, so the first line in a lot of stylesheets or pre-processor files is * { box-sizing: border-box; }. The spec can't change as it would break legacy pages' layout so we're stuck with this fix.</p>
<p>That's fine, and I don't believe that using the universal selector * causes any real performance issues. Browsers are fast enough and smart enough to take it in their stride. However, I do hit problems with this reset approach. Frameworks.</p>
<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
I've recently tried moving a site which just uses custom CSS and a reset over to Bootstrap 3. Bootstrap uses box-sizing:content-box by default so you chuck in that universal selector and all hell breaks loose. I think that to work with a framework like Bootstrap you have to respect the content-box option and just apply border-box to any custom modules that need it. Basically, if you're using the framework, use the framework, don't half use it.
<h3>Table Cells</h3>
It's worth noting how table cells behave. They basically have box-sizing border-box by default so padding gets applied inwards. A border between 2 cells gets centered across the cells, so if we have 2 cells with a border of width 10px between them, 5px is effectively within each cell's width.
<p>You can change the box-sizing property on a cell to content-box but, in short, don't. It's not clear how this should behave and is inconsistent across browsers.</p>
