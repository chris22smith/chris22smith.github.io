    <p>I recently got an Android TV box, which enables you to get Android apps and put them on your TV. I decided to look into ZX Spectrum emulators and after trying 2 or 3 soon settled on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.dejvice.rc.Marvin&amp;hl=en_GB" target="_blank">Marvin</a>, presumably named after the paranoid android in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, as my choice.</p>
<p>It automatically hooks up with <a href="https://www.worldofspectrum.org/" target="_blank">World of Spectrum</a>, allowing you to quickly search their huge archive of games and download any you want.</p>
<p>I'd recommend going into the options and getting rid of the joystick and keys as they're not much use in a non touch environment and are pretty ugly.</p>
<p>Playing games with just a remote control is a bit of a non-starter so I'd recommend getting a Bluetooth keyboard. A mini one is fine and pretty cheap. Marvin even has options so that you can map your chosen control method - keyboard, cursor joystick, Kempston joystick, Sinclair joystick - to the directional pad. This makes it a lot easier than trying to use Q, A, O, P, M or whatever keyboard configuration you're used to.</p>

It's a bit of a cult classic and has sites dedicated to it and numerous spin-offs. It's stood the test of time incredibly well given that it's now coming up toÂ 30 years since its release.</p>
<p>I've even managed to get my kids, 12 and 10, interested so it must have something about it.</p>
<p>Long live the ZX Spectrum!</p>
