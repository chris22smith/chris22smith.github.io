      <h1>Web Design for the non-designer</h1>
    <p>The first thing to do is to have a clear distinction in your head between content and style. Content is the text and images that visitors read and look at; style is how these are arranged, laid out and presented.The style side is where the <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">web designer</a> comes in. This is his/her main area of expertise and he/she will have the <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">design skills</a> to present your content in a way which communicates your message clearly and professionally.</p>
<p>The content is the site owner's responsibility. In <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11" target="_self">website marketing</a> content is king. The main reason a visitor will come back to your site is because he/she found what they were looking for. The look and feel are very much secondary to this.</p>
<p>Creating your content can appear a little daunting if you've never thought about it before, even for a small site, but it's really quite simple if you approach it in the right way. You may not have designed a site before but you have used plenty of sites. The trick, as with any marketing, is to put yourself in the visitor's shoes. You need to consider:</p>
<ul>
	<li>When they come to your site, what are their objectives - what might they want to go away with?</li>
	<li>What information will they expect to see?</li>
	<li>What other information might be helpful to them?</li>
</ul>
If you can consider these things you will satisfy your website's visitors. The next step is to check out the online competition.
<ul>
	<li>What do similar sites (your competitors) offer?</li>
	<li>Can you offer anything that they don't?</li>
	<li>Can you make your site more useable than theirs?</li>
</ul>
If you can give your website visitors what they want better than your competitors do you have a recipe for a successful site. Pair that with professional styling and your site will be a great success.
