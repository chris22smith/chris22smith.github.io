      <h1>What is a website visitor worth?</h1>
    <p>When looking at investing money in trying to get <a href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11" target="_self">more visitors to your website</a> you need to first work out what a visitor is worth to you.</p>
<p>So, how do you work it out? Well, to do it at a basic level is very simple. Choose a time period to analyse - the last 12 months, last 3 months, last 30 days, etc. Now, in this period see how much profit you made and how many visitors your website got. If you're using a web stats package, unique visitors is the figure to use here. Simply divide the number of unique visitors by the profit and this will give you a mean profit per visitor. You can use this as a basis for spending on <a href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11" target="_blank">gaining more visitors</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst more visitors means more profit you shouldn't just look at <a href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11" target="_self">boosting traffic</a> but try to actively increase the value of each online visitor. If a visitor becomes more likely to buy from you they become more valuable and investing money in <a href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11" target="_self">attracting more visitors</a> then gives you <a href="https://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp" target="_self">better value for money</a>. So, as well as your traffic you also need to try to improve your conversion rate. The conversion rate is simply the proportion of visitors who buy. There are lots of things you can do to boost your conversion rates but that's for another day...</p>
