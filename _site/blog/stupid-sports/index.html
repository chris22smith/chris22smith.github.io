    <p>The triple-jump. What's that all about? It used to be called the &quot;hop, skip and jump&quot;. It's the long jump with a &quot;Ministry of Silly Walks&quot; run-up. It's competing to see who can do 3 different things in a sequence. Why not have the &quot;stand-up, sit-down, javelin&quot; or the &quot;run backwards, cartwheel, pole-vault&quot;?</p>
<p>In the (Winter) Olympics there's the Olympic Biathlon. A biathlon is 2 events or skills combined. It's the almost unguessable cross country skiing and rifle shooting. Doesn't seem like an obvious or particularly practical combination to me. Skateboard archery, anyone?</p>
<p>I can see that humans wanting to establish who is the fastest, strongest, best jumper, best thrower is something that goes back to the earliest civilisations and it makes sense. I can even understand hurdles or pole-vault as skills which might have once had an application in the wild. Concocting weird variations of these to open up more sports just seems ridiculous.</p>
<p>How do people get involved in these odd secondary sports? Isn't a triple-jumper just someone who couldn't compete as a long-jumper so went on a date with its weird younger sister?</p>
