    <p>&quot;Hey Siri&quot;, &quot;OK Google&quot;, &quot;Hey Cortana&quot;. It still feels weird to me.</p>
<p>As I'm a Windows user Cortana is my &quot;virtual assistant&quot; of choice. It's an incredibly useful service and getting better all the time so I wonder why I don't use it more. I'm learning slowly. For example, I just wanted to work out 500 divided by 52. In the past I would have opened the calculator programme or app, typed in my request and got my answer. Today, however, I just said this: &quot;Hey Cortana, what's five hundred divided by fifty-two.&quot; And, about a second later I had my answer. Much faster.</p>
<p>I caught myself saying, &quot;thank you&quot;, and immediately felt like an idiot. But actually, that's not shameful at all, just polite. So what if it was redundant. I'm still human.</p>
<p>I think there are 2 main reasons why I don't use it more. Firstly, I just don't think of it. I'm a bit set in my ways and am too used to typing. Secondly, I'm self-conscious about using it within earshot of other people. It still feels a bit weird, talking to your computer, and I imagine others who can't hear clearly enough to make out my words wondering who I'm talking to. So, I tend to only use Cortana when I'm on my own, which is even weirder, right? Though, as I never see or hear anyone else using these assistant services I'm guessing I'm probably not alone in this.</p>
<p>I'm going to try to push through the weirdness and make it more normal in my circles.</p>
<p>Just for fun, if you're using Cortana, say this: &quot;Hey Cortana, what does the fox say?&quot; Do it a few times - you'll get a variety of answers. I guess it probably works on the other assistants too.</p>
