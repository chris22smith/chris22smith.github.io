    <p>My website, www.chris-smith-web.com, is 5 years old today.</p>
<p>I registered the domain name and started building the site on 15th June 2004. This has made me all nostalgic so I thought I'd take a quick look back over the last 5 years and how the site and business has changed in that time.</p>
<p>I registered the domain with a company called <a title="123 Reg" href="https://www.123-reg.co.uk" target="_blank">123-reg</a> whom I still use to this day. They provide good value domain registration with a nice simple control panel. I also hosted my first site with them though now I have moved on, mainly due to the more advanced technologies I now use.</p>
<p><strong>2004</strong></p>
<p>My first design was fairly basic but, looking back on it now, I still like its simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p>Although it was a new site it managed to bring in some good enquiries and before long I was off and running.</p>
<p>I can still remember my first enquiry and the first website I built for a client very clearly.</p>
<p><strong>2006</strong></p>
<p>As the &quot;cheap web design&quot; market got more and more competitive I needed to redesign the site to try to improve its search engine rankings. I tried using an individual web page for each individual service I could offer.</p>
<p>With hindsight, I think what I gained in web traffic I lost in conversions as this design failed to impress web development seekers.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>Another year on the web was changing and Web 2.0 technologies were becoming more common. I decided I needed a different design with a fresher, more vibrant feel. This design change saw a marked improvement in my enquiry levels.</p>
<p>I also started using server side technology to create more interactivity.</p>
<p><strong>Today</strong></p>
<p>My site now uses a blogging model and has articles as its centre rather than just the static pages about my services. This model is strong on the search engine side and my visitor numbers are higher than ever. It also means I get to write about the things that I'm passionate about - web development and online marketing.</p>
<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>
<p>I'm just in the process of launching a new site focused on Online Marketing. Please take a look at Chris Smith Marketing, www.chrissmithmarketing.com.</p>
