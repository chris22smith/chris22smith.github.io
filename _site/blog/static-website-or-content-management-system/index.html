      <h1>Static Website or Content Management System?</h1>
    <p>If you've decided you want a website, the next decision to be made is which kind - a simple, static website or a Content Management System (CMS)? Let's have a look at the pros and cons of each kind.</p>
<h2>Static website</h2>
<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>As it's simpler it's quicker. I can produce a static site in a matter of days at a push.</li>
	<li>When it comes to design, there are no restrictions.</li>
	<li>It's cheaper. Cheaper to initially build and cheaper to run.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If you want to update it you have to contact the web developer and wait for him/her to update the content for you.</li>
	<li>If you want to use an XML sitemap you have to have it updated manually each time you change your content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Content Management System</h2>
<strong>Pros</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You can update the site's content whenever you want, from wherever you want, provided you've got an internet connection.</li>
	<li>It's even possible to update your website by email.</li>
	<li>As the site structure is dynamic all navigatoin is handled for you. For example, if you add a new page it automatically appears on the menus.</li>
	<li>Your XML sitemap is automatically updated every time you change the site's content, meaning the search engines can keep up you.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cons</strong>
<ul>
	<li>It's more expensive. The set up takes longer and the web hosting costs more.</li>
	<li>The web designer doesn't have quite as much creative freedom as he'she has to fit in with the CMS framework.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In the end it boils down to how much content you are dealing with and how frequently that content is going to change.</p>
<p>If you are starting up a new business it may be worth taking advantage of the tax breaks allowed as start-up costs and go for the CMS.</p>
