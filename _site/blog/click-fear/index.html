    <p>I recently read this excellent article by Jakob Nielsen:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/" target="_blank">The Distribution of Users' Computer Skills: Worse Than You Think</a></p>
<p>It highlights just how bad most people are with using software and websites and how we should not judge our users by our own standards and preferences. As I read it I thought to myself that I don't really know anyone with poor skills - everyone I know is pretty good at this kind of stuff. Later the same day I was proved wrong.</p>
<p>I got a call from a friend asking for my help on going through a process online. The options provided seemed obvious to me, even over the phone. They described what they wanted to do and then the 2 options on screen. The first was an exact match for their intention; the second something completely different. It made me realise that it's often not so much a case of not understanding what to do as being afraid to commit to it and wanting that extra reassurance.</p>
<p>Some people have a fear that once they've pressed a button that's it and there's no going back and they're scared that they may make the wrong choice. I've noticed that a lot of websites have &quot;call to action&quot; buttons with text like &quot;Sign up&quot; or &quot;Buy now&quot;. For these users with the fear, this could be a red light - they will see that action as a commitment they may not want. Those of us who know, know that this is just to initiate a process rather than to commit to it. It might be prudent to be cautious with actions and reflect more faithfully what will actually happen.</p>
<p>There shouldn't be any need for this fear. Anything that can be done can be undone, or changed later. Well, almost anything. I can think of a few instances where choosing a username is a permanent choice but it's usually made clear if something cannot be changed.</p>
<p>To use a not-particularly-thought-through analogy, navigating through any kind of process online is a bit like driving around a car park. Whichever route you take you can always loop back around and get back to where you were. Worst case scenario - you can always exit and enter again.</p>
