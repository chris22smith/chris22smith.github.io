      <h1>Google Chrome - first impressions</h1>
    <p>I thought I'd just give my tuppence worth on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a>'s new BETA browser, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a>.</p>
<p>When I first heard about <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google's new browser</a> it was with dread. As a <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/" target="_self">web developer</a> an important part of developing any web page or application is testing that it works in the major browsers. Having another browser on the scene, and with a big name like <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a> behind it you know it's going to have a lot of users, means more testing and increases my chances of having to recode.</p>
<p>Before downloading it I read <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a>'s page on <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-GB/why.html?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">Why We Built A Browser</a>. The page itself is titled &quot;A fresh take on the browser&quot;. On it <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a> openly admits &quot;We've used components from <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a>'s <a href="http://webkit.org/" target="_blank">WebKit</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>'s <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>&quot;. So, maybe not an entirely fresh take then?</p>
<p>So, on going in, what are my first impressions? Well, first thought, it looks pretty much the same as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx" target="_blank"><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr></a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>. The browsing tabs have been shifted above the address bar, which, as far as I can see, is just a change for change's sake rather than serving any useful purpose - why make people have to get used to something new when the browers they are used to work just fine? Other than that, without delving too deep, I'm struggling to find anything radically different.</p>
<p>On the plus side, it doesn't have loads of toolbars, keeping a nice clean, simple appearance - one of the great strengths of <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google's search engine</a>. After using it for a while, I noticed that it remembers the sites you visit and uses this data intelligently to make it quicker to revisit them. It's fast too, noticeably quicker than <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products" target="_blank">IE</a>.</p>
<p>On the negative side, it doesn't seem to handle RSS feeds and feed reading as well as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products" target="_blank">IE</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> (with RSS add-ons) but I'm sure this will come.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> has been the <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/" target="_self">web professional</a>'s choice for years now and with good reason. So, will <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> offer us anything new that <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> can't? As I see it, the reason for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>'s success hasn't been about speed or security but freedom. It's great strength is that it's so easy to customise and ease of using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" target="_blank">add-ons</a> make it much more than a tool for reading web content. I'm assuming that, being an open source project, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a> will follow suit.</p>
<p>It seems a shame to me that all of the excellent <a href="http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/" target="_self">developers</a> out there who have been building add-ons for <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> will now be split between <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Chrome</a>.</p>
<p>I don't think that <a href="http://www.google.co.uk" target="_blank">Google</a> will better <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/" target="_blank">Firefox</a> but they will be able to match it and with their finances and history of buying up big web companies (<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a>) I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we saw Google Firefox before too long.</p>
<p>See what you think - <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a></p>
