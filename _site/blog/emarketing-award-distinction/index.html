    <p>This summer I studied the <a title="CIM" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cim.co.uk" target="_blank">Chartered Institute of Marketing</a> (CIM)'s <a title="eMarketing Award" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marketingtom.com/emarketing_award.html" target="_blank">eMarketing Award</a>. Last night I got my results in the post...</p>
<p>I'm proud to say that I achieved <strong>grade A distinctions</strong> in both my online examination and 4,000 word eMarketing report.</p>
<p>The course covers all aspects of <strong>electronic marketing</strong>.  I studied with <a title="Marketing Tom" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marketingtom.com" target="_blank">Marketing Tom Media</a>, a CIM approved centre based near Cardiff, and would certainly recommend both course and <a href="https://www.marketingtom.com" target="_blank">training provider</a> to anyone interested in growing their business online.</p>
<p>Perhaps what is most satisfying is that the report which I wrote is not simply being filed away as an academic exercise but is actually being used as a <strong>strategy</strong> for a major organisation's <strong>electronic marketing activities</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to this I have taken on board many of the <strong>tactics</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> covered by the course and have <strong>successfully grown</strong> a number of websites. Since attending the course I have rebuilt this website and started using lots of online resources, my favourite being FeedBurner. My site now gets 3 to 4 times the <strong>traffic </strong>it had previously, ranks much higher in <strong>Google</strong> search listings and has brought in <strong>more enquiries</strong>, which is the real measure of its success.</p>
