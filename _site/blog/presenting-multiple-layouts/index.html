      <h1>Presenting Multiple Layouts</h1>
    <p>I'm sure everyone has seen web apps where the user is given a choice of layouts for their data. Sometimes you can view items as a list or as cards and there's a mechanism of flipping between them. Gmail has options of Comfortable, Cosy or Compact.</p>
<p>From the developer's point of view, it seems like a nice little extra. It's fairly easy to do in CSS - just toggle a root class on the module andÂ set your styles for each layout.</p>
<p>Having done this a few times now, my advice would be a pretty emphatic <strong>don't!</strong> It starts off as a simple variation but it means that every time you make a small change to the content or layout in one layout you have to do this development for each, and then test in each. In short it multiplies out the work.</p>
<p>Imagine offering the user a choice of 3 layouts and 3 colour themes. That's 9 scenarios for the poor tester to check every time you make even the slightest tweak.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with putting work into a UI but in this case the benefit to the end user is negligible for a lot of additional effort. It would be far better to spend the time just doing one layout really well.</p>
<p>I think there can be occasions where it can work, like just toggling a module font size or line-height but getting into different sets of styling rules is a big no-no for me.</p>
