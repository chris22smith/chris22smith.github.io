    <p>I was recently using <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk" target="_blank">Amazon</a> at home and my 4 year old son joined me. After I'd completed my ordering he asked me if he could have a go. To put this in context he's at the stage where he can recognise brands (e.g. Tesco, M&amp;S, etc.), his own name and a few letters but can't actually read other words.</p>
<p>I found it fascinating to observe how he managed to use the site easily despite not being able to read.</p>
<p>He clicked the logo taking him back to the home page. On there he saw a product image he liked (Star Wars video game), clicked it. On this page he clicked a play icon to watch a video preview of the game. When that ended he clicked the yellow button with a shopping basket icon to buy it. He then looked further down the screen where Amazon displays other related products - items other customers bought or viewed - and found some Star Wars toys. By following this process of clicking on related products and adding them to the basket he soon had over Â£300 of toys and video games in the basket. He even seemed to understand the product star rating system.</p>
<p>This speaks volumes about how good the design of this site is.</p>
<p>It can be navigated without any need for reading text. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk" target="_blank">Amazon</a>'s use of images and dynamically generating related images is superb. The human brain processes and recognises images and icons much faster than it can read text.</p>
<p>It's obvious how to buy something even to someone with almost no previous internet experience. A clear button which stands out from the rest of the page bearing a shopping basket icon leaves no doubt about how you proceed to buy the product.</p>
<p>One final tip - if you've got young children make sure you don't leave yourself logged in to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk" target="_blank">Amazon</a> or Father Christmas might be back sooner than you'd expect.</p>
