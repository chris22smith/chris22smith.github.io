Here goes…\r\n<h3>Professional</h3>\r\nI work as a front-end developer, designing user interfaces and doing UX work for a rapidly growing software company.\r\n\r\nI started working on the web in 1999, back when it was still largely tables, frames and footers crammed with long lists of keywords. I started with a book on HTML and got a copy of Microsoft FrontPage coding up web pages for IE5. Ooh yeah. I got a book on JavaScript but never really clicked with the whole IE vs Netscape business so moved on to CSS. Knowing some CSS made jQuery selectors easy to learn and it wasn't long before I could do DOM stuff and then Ajax. Since then I've learnt vanilla JavaScript, well, always still learning, and worked with a few frameworks - Knockout.js, Angular.js and have more recently dabbled with React and TypeScript.\r\n<h3>Personal</h3>\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mid-wales.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-134\"><img class=\"circle alignright wp-image-134 size-medium\" src=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mid-wales-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Mid Wales hill scene\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" style=\"border-radius:.25em;\" /></a>I live in a small town in beautiful green Mid Wales with my wife and 2 sons. There are more sheep than people around here. True.\r\n\r\nAt different times I've lived, studied and worked in rural Herefordshire, Birmingham, Siena (Italy), Swansea and London.\r\n\r\nWhen not working I like playing around with other little web projects like this site, <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith\">Codepen</a> and <a href=\"http://dinowebs.net\">dinowebs.net</a> (so, still kind of working), playing football (soccer to some people), going running, playing guitars (when I find the time) and then a load more pretty average stuff that everybody does.",

    "post_content": "After years of working on all sorts of websites I thought I’d create my own personal site. I’ve created quite a few sites for myself before but they have always been about my web design and development work or (failed) entrepreneurial attemps to generate a bit of money. This is different. I’m not looking to gain any money, work or reputation, just giving myself a platform to publish, well, whatever the hell I feel like.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure what will go on it yet, maybe a bit of a blog, maybe some articles, photos, video, music. Or I might just fill pages with adverts and animated GIFs. Seems to work for some people.\r\n<h3>The Design</h3>\r\nI thought I’d just share some of the thinking and technical approach behind the design. As a web designer/developer I don’t want the site to be just about its content, I see it as a bit of a playground for trying out new design ideas.\r\n\r\nTo begin with I’ve focused on keeping the design as clean, clear and simple as possible. It’s fully responsive so works on devices of all shapes and sizes. I’ve also kept the technology involved to a minimum serving up static HTML files for maximum speed.\r\n\r\nGoing forwards I’m sure I’ll play around with different design ideas so not all pages will look the same. We’ll see what happens.\r\n\r\nAnyway, enough. Hope you enjoy. Now go and do something more useful.",

    "post_content": "At the moment Facebook has 3 ways you can interact with posts: Like, Comment and Share. All three of these do slightly different things but they all contribute towards a post’s popularity score, which determines how likely it is to appear in people’s news streams. It makes a lot of sense for users to be shown content that people like or interact with (comments could be negative) rather than content people are indifferent to. In short, it’s a system designed to reward and promote interesting content.\r\n\r\nFacebook is cleverer than this. It records which other users you interact with most and gives their future posts priority in your stream so you see more from those people you have historically found interesting. Good job Facebook barons!\r\n\r\nI think we need the opposite, a way of penalising and demoting the content that we find boring. The way I imagine it working is having a Yawn link with the other options. The main difference with this one is that it would have to be anonymous. We don’t want people to be offended, cause tension or break up friendships. It’s also not intended as a way of judging the quality of other people’s content - what one person finds interesting might be boring to someone else or maybe it’s an in-joke that they just don’t get. It’s about filtering the right content for the right people.\r\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\r\nMy issue with Facebook right now is that everyone just broadcasts everything to everyone, nothing is targeted. When you write a post you have the option to decide who sees it. You can select individuals, exclude individuals or set up your friends in groups and choose which see it and which don’t. But nobody does. It’s very odd. Think of the last thing you posted on Facebook. Imagine taking that content and putting it into an email and sending it to everyone in your address book. You wouldn't. I'm sure even though most outgoing people would maybe untick one or two contacts. And this all means that we end up reading lots of content that really isn't ever meant for us. And the whole Facebook experience becomes irrelevant and ultimately boring.\r\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\r\nIf I post something and it gets 1 Like but 20 Yawns it’ll make me think twice about posting something like that again. But I thought everyone was into learning JavaScript frameworks? I guess you’re all just weirdos. :) What it will do is, the next time I'm enthusiastic about some nerdy tech thing, it’ll make me think about who might be interested and I'll share it just with them. In this particular case, there’s a fair chance it’ll be nobody but that’s fine.",

    "post_content": "What is wrong with the England football team? Why haven’t the senior men’s team won any major tournaments since 1966? What needs to change to increase the chances of success in the future?\r\n\r\nI read quite a few articles, watch the pundits on TV, listen to radio shows and podcasts and the various ex-players and journalists continuously come up with the same reasons why England have “underperformed”.\r\n\r\nI’m not wholly convinced by any of it.\r\n<h3>Club vs. Country</h3>\r\nI’ve heard it said that players don’t want to play for England. There may have been one or two instances with meaningless friendlies ahead of major league ties but for the most part I don’t buy this as an argument. I think it’s every footballer’s dream to be playing for his country in the major tounaments. That said, I’ve never understood players “retiring from international football”. I don’t see any shame in naturally falling out of favour and being replaced by younger players. If Joey Barton can “retire”, well, I may as well declare myself out too.\r\n<h3>Poor Quality Coaching</h3>\r\nI’m not sure about this one either. Whilst I have to admit that improving coaching at grass roots level can only be a positive thing for the long term future of English football, I don’t see that there’s some major problem. We have lots of very promising young players emerging. Talented players come in waves. Always have, always will. Just like you get strong years and weaker years in school pupils.\r\n\r\nDoing well internationally is partly down to luck in having a strong group all coming through at once. Just look at the Belgium line up now and compare it to the squads they had at the last few tournaments.\r\n<h3>More English in the Premier League</h3>\r\nMany blame the high number of foreign players in the Premier League. I keep hearing different numbers but I think currently somewhere around 35% of Premier League players are English. If 20 teams have 25 players registered for the league, 500 players, that’s a pool of 175 English players from which to find a squad of 23. Increasing the quota of English players and adding to this pool wouldn’t push up the quality, only the quantity. In reality, this isn’t the extent of the pool anyway as English players playing in other leagues are also eligible. If the quota was increased they would be the same players. Playing well in the Championship or in a foreign league must be better than being a benchwarmer in the Premier League.\r\n<h3>Hibernation</h3>\r\nApparently, our players are tired at the end of a long season and we need a winter break to magically make it all better. I struggle to see how having a couple of weeks off in December or January has much impact on how players are feeling by the end of May. The “experts” always claim that the German and Spanish leagues have a winter break and that gives them an advantage. Well, on the evidence of the 2014 World Cup, one won it and the other went home early. Hardly conclusive evidence.\r\n\r\nWith all the commercial activity around pre season tours, do people really think that the players would get a break? Or would they be flown out to the UAE to play in exhibition matches?\r\n<h3>Not So Good Tekkers</h3>\r\nThere’s a view that English players lack technical skill, that we’re not as good technically as the Spanish or the South Americans. I can see that some nations do seem to thrive on close control and are able to keep possession under pressure much better than England. Chile, in particular, have been masters of keeping possession in the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nWhilst this sort of possession game can be highly effective and getting better at this would certainly be a benefit, I see little point in England trying to play these nations at their own game. If we play a side like Spain or Chile and try to dominate possession we will be humiliated. It makes more sense to use other tactics. Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid was able to overcome Barcelona by playing a more physical game - adapting for the opposition. Germany don’t especially play a possession game - they focus on counter attcking, moving the ball very quickly when their opponents are most vulnerable. Technical skill is to be admired but it’s not the only route to success.\r\n<h3>Germanic Panic</h3>\r\nI’ve heard a lot of football experts praising the revolution in German football, the way Klinsmann and Loew created a national identity and way of playing which is consistent between the clubs and the national side. I’m a little sceptical. I struggle to see how all clubs can play in the same style and still compete. Surely experimenting with styles and tactics is a major part of trying to gain an advantage on your competition? The other part which doesn’t quite convince me is that Germany have always been a major force in international tournaments. The World Cup in Brazil may have been the first they’ve won since 1990 but they’ve never been far away. They’re consistently in the semi-finals of most tournaments, revolution or no revolution. Where I do think they’ve got it right is fitting the players to a system, not shoe-horning a system around popular players.\r\n<h3>Well?</h3>\r\nI think they’re looking at it all wrong. I think there are other, much simpler reasons behind it.\r\n<h3>FTW! Maybe FTD?</h3>\r\nIn a league a team with a strong attack but weaker defence can still do well. A prime example is Liverpool finishing second in the 2013/2014 season. A team more focused on attacking and hoping to outscore their opponent is likely to pick up more wins over the course of a season. In a tournament this kind of gamble can see you quickly knocked out. Your luck will run out at some point.\r\n\r\nWhilst scoring goals helps to win games, having a weak defence helps to lose them. However, having a watertight defence can at least ensure a draw and give a chance of progressing through penalty shootouts. Thinking about recent tournaments most eventual winners either progressed through penalties or extra time at some point. I can’t remember the last time a winner won all their games in normal time. So, there’s definitely an element of playing it safe and hoping for a bit of luck. It’s also human nature. Every international team is under huge pressure from fans and the media. Being eliminated from a tournament in extra time or penalties feels more like bad luck than poor performance so is somehow more respectable. If you’re going to be knocked out it’s better to go this way.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, England went out after 2 games because they were poor defensively. Everyone knew that going into the tournament. It was probably the weakest back 4 we’ve ever had going into a World Cup and so it’s not a great shock that it’s the earliest we’ve ever been knocked out. Theoretically, in competitions with 32 teams and assuming you qualify from the group stage, if you play ultra-defensively, enough to keep each knockout match at 0-0 and bring it down to a 50/50 shootout, you have a 1 in 16 chance of winning the tournament. So, that’s a tournament win every 32 years. Hard to actually pull off but it worked for Greece.\r\n<h3>You’re the Weakest Link</h3>\r\nA team’s only as good as its weakest player. In major tournaments there’s always a massive focus on the big star players but football statistics bear out the fact that results are dictated by teams’ weaknesses rather than their strengths. If there’s any weakness at this level it will be exploited and is likely to influence the outcome of a game. It’s not necessarily the teams with the big names who do well at major tournaments but those with the fewest holes. England have certainly gone into the last few tournaments with known weaknesses - players in unfamiliar roles, defence not being used to playing together, lack of goal threat, etc.\r\n<h3>The Grass is Always Greener</h3>\r\nWhenever any team does badly or fails to live up to expectation they look for the knee-jerk reaction and to do the opposite of what they did before. England appointed Fabio Capello, a manager with an amazing track record in club football. After “failing” at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa - knee-jerk - the next manager must be English. Personally, I feel much more comfortable having an English manager but I don’t believe it is any more or any less likely to lead to success.\r\n\r\nA prime example of the grass always being greener is Brazil. After the humiliating way in which they were knocked out of the World Cup on home soil, playing very attacking football, they’ve knee-jerked by appointing Dunga, a very defensive pragmatist. The same happened following their loss to Uruguay in the 1950 final. They abandoned their exciting exhibitionist style and went on the defensive.\r\n<h3>What’s the Answer?</h3>\r\nPersonally, I don’t think we’ve actually got anything that wrong. We just need to bide our time and need that bit of luck in the latter stages. Is the answer trying to find a quick fix through special FA committees? Probably not.",

    "post_content": "I thought I’d take a look back through all the new tech that I’ve learnt in 2014. Most of it is genuinely learning new things from scratch but some is polishing up on things I haven’t used for a while or taking things further than I had before. It’s a much longer list than I had expected so I’ve broken it down into 3 articles. Hopefully, it’ll be handy to come back to in the future when I’ve forgotten it all again.\r\n<h3>HTML</h3>\r\nI’ve discovered a couple of new things in HTML5. As they’re APIs I uess they’re really Javascript more than HTML. I’ve learned a bit about the Speech API - speech synthesis (turning text content into audio) and speech recognition (turning microphone input into text). It’s still early days and, at the time of writing, only works in Chrome but has some exciting possibilities for both greater accessibility and the ability to use the web without having to look at a page.\r\n\r\nMy other discovery this year has been the progress element for adding a progress bar to a page. All browsers make these look very different by default but it’s not too hard to style them for consistency if that’s what you want. Like many other HTML5 elements it has nice fallback syntax for non HTML5 browsers.\r\n<h3>CSS</h3>\r\nI’d previously only used transitions for adding a bit of a delay into hover effects but it’s great for changing the size or position or page elements too. It works very nicely combined with transform:rotate. I’ve actually found a great practical use for transitions in creating a multi-state button, which changes from displaying “Save” to “Saving…” and then “Saved” with different styling for each state.\r\n\r\nI’ve now learned how to do proper keyframe animations in CSS without the need for any Javascript. The possibilities are endless. Just need to make sure I’m not chucking them in everywhere for the sake of it.\r\n\r\nIt’s been a while since I’ve had to deal with print media styling. I was hoping things would have improved in the last few years but still find it quite tricky. I found myself having to use a lot of !important in my properties to gain control. Maybe considering print later in the design process rather than from the outset was a mistake with hindsight?\r\n<h3>Fonts</h3>\r\nI’ve started making full use of web fonts, particularly Google Fonts. The basic implementation is very easy, just a link to an external CSS file which loads the font-face, but they’re not always consistent across operating systems and browsers so it takes quite a bit of testing to be sure your chosen font will appear nicely across the board. Working out whether to install additional font variants for bold and italic or whether to just let the browser apply its own faux bold and italic effects is another issue. Given the extra HTTP requests and page weight I’m tending to stick with “web safe” fonts for body text and only use web fonts for headings or elements requiring a bit more styling.\r\n\r\nI’ve found that I can actually create my own font variants by playing around with the CSS letter-spacing property, using things like letter-spacing:-1px, on “web safe” fonts.\r\n<h3>Images</h3>\r\nI haven’t learned much new with images but have found a couple of handy new techniques. I’ve started using base64 format for smaller images instead of referencing external files. This means putting the file data into a continuous stream of characters in the CSS file instead of using a path another file. This still gets cached as part of the CSS but prevents an additional HTTP request. As base64 format is actually a little bigger in file size than refreencing the image directly it only makes sense for smaller files. For larger files it makes more sense to benefit from the smaller file size at the expense of the extra request. Good CSS editors will also show you a preview of the image as you hover over the base654 code, which is handy as it’s completely unintelligible.\r\n\r\nI’ve started using some very basic SVG. It seems fairly straightforward but I’m still not sure about the sizing and scaling. One for next year.",

    "post_content": "This is the second part of a three-part article looking back at what new web things I’ve learned in 2014. This part focuses on JavaScript.\r\n<h3>JavaScript and jQuery</h3>\r\nThis is a big area, probably the area where I have made the most progress in the last year. The main shift for me has been from doing everything in jQuery, which I learned first, to using native JavaScript. Hopefully by learning to do more with native Javascript I can cut down on the jQuery bloat, especially in mobile friendly pages.\r\n\r\nIn “vanilla JavaScript” I’ve learnt to use a few new built-in functions, which perform very well in modern browsers. One of the things that really slows down a page’s performance in JavaScript is looping through a long list of items and performing various operations within each. I’ve learned four new functions which perform operations very quickly - map, filter, forEach and reduce. I would urge anyone using standard for loops to look into these. One for loop operation I tried on a list of 10,000 items killed Chrome. Switching to using map it worked in under a second. I believe that jQuery’s each and filter functions already leverage these bult-in functions. The other useful thing I’ve discovered when working with loops is to move anything you can outside of the loop, e.g. a function. Don’t declare it every time - just do it once and call it each time.\r\n\r\nI’ve finally got the hang of the ternary operator. This just means that I can now write my conditional statements in a much more compact way, things like return (confirmed) ? true : false;. If the variable ‘confirmed’ is truthy, return true, otherwise return false.\r\n\r\nA great discovery in the last couple of months has been the hashchange event. The browser can detect changes to the part of the URL that appears after the #. This means that when we use links to change something like filter the data in a table, instead of the link’s href bring empty or set to the meaningless “#”, we can put something meaningful in there. For example our href could be “#female” and the URL will change to reflect this. The hashchange event will listen for this change and we can then grab the part after the hash symbol using window.location.hash and do our filtering. This has the added bonus of appearing in the browser’s history so the user can hit their back button to undo a filter. Much better and feels like this is how it’s supposed to work.\r\n\r\nI think I’ve now understood how to properly use functions and objects in JavaScript to set the appropriate scope for variables. Wrapping functionality in functions means that each function is its own self-contained unit, which means no unexpected or conflicting references cropping up and it makes the code easier to maintain and test.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year I wrote a jQuery script to handle pagination in a HTML table. I won’t go into the horribly complicated detail here but the learning point for me was to get the logic clear in my mind before getting into the code. I actually went back to pen and paper, sketching out the various scenarios and then finding the patterns to create my code.\r\n\r\nJavaScript Frameworks and jQuery Plugins\r\nThanks to a very patient colleague I’ve now got a much better grip on Angular.js. I can now work with not just binding data in the HTML but can also write directives to create new page components and services to handle commonly required functions.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Angular work I’ve also learned how to do Unit Testing using the Jasmine framework. Unit testing always felt like a lot of extra work to me but now I see that having a long list of small tests that run is invaluable. It gives you the freedom to write new code knowing that any knock-on effects you create in the process will be picked up. It makes for far more robust and less buggy code.\r\n\r\nRecently, I’ve implemented 2 jQuery plugins into a project, tablesorter for automatically sorting the rows of a table by clicking on a column heading, and elevateZoom for adding the capability of zooming in on a thumbnail image, like we often see on clothing details pages. Both are very well written with a lot of options available. Using these has made me realise that I can now go into the code of the plugins and actually follow (more or less) what is going on. I hope to be able to write and share some of my own in the next couple of years.\r\n<h3>Google Maps API v.3</h3>\r\nI’ve now spent a few months working with this API and have got a good understanding of how it works and how it can be used and extended to do more. I created my own utility library of functions for all the things I need to do regularly - draw markers and polygons with info windows which appear on click, calculating areas, converting area units, adding data layers and heatmaps, encoding/decoding polygon paths, adding new map controls, etc. There was also some more advanced functionality in there too which goes beyond what’s included in the API - calculating the optimal bounds (map viewport) to show a number of polygons, determining the direction or winding (clockwise or anti/counter-clockwise) of a polygon, calculating the centroid (centre from the average coordinates of points) of a polygon.\r\n\r\nI’ve also used some third party features to extend the mapping functionality. One of these has allowed me to cluster markers so rather than have a lot of marekrs close together on screen we show a number of markers, much neater. Another has enabled me to place text labels on the map, which isn’t possible out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nThe key tricks that I have picked up along the way are to 1) push any markers or polygons into an array so you can access them easily in JavaScript and 2) add your own custom properties to the native objects for markers and polygons, e.g. id or name, so that you can identify them easily in code.",

    "post_content": "This is the final part of a three-part article looking back on new things I’ve discovered in 2014. This part is just a round up of all the other bits and pieces not mentioned in the other parts and a bit of a look forward to 2015.\r\n<h3>Google Analytics</h3>\r\nI’ve used Analytics for years but haven’t really used it in any depth for the last couple of years. It’s changed. Quite a lot. All in a good way. It can do a lot more now than before. It seems to be moving closer towards the Webmaster Tools and used well can actually help you improve not only the user experience through design but also the performance of your site through the Behaviour &gt; Page Speed data and suggestions.\r\n<h3>ASP.NET MVC</h3>\r\nI don’t do a lot server side but colleagues of mine have made excellent use of the EditorFor functionality and partial views to create reusable dynamic page components.\r\n\r\nMy biggest discovery has been Bundling and Minification of JavaScript and CSS assets. It allows you to create bundles of files and then concatenates them into one long file before minifying it and changing the references. This could mean one single request for all JavaScript, which is then cached - much better for performance and page loading times.\r\n<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>\r\nI still feel like I’m quite new to this but have made some good progress this year. I now understand the basics of mobile and viewport sizing and scaling. I’ve also got the hang of media queries for changing font-sizes and positions of elements based on screen width. I’ve kind of taught myself by looking at the code of sites that do it well rather than by using any tutorials. It seems to be a good shortcut for now. There’s definitely a lot more to learn here but I’m pleased how painless it’s been so far.\r\n<h3>Brackets</h3>\r\nI’ve recently started using Adobe Brackets, which is an open source code editor available from brackets.io. It’s got everything I need, looks good and from the progress I’ve seen in its first few months it’s going to move pretty fast. The thing I love about it is that it’s built in front end technologies - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.\r\n<h2>To Do List for 2015</h2>\r\nSo, now I see how much I’ve learned in the last year it’s time to start thinking about what’s next for 2015.\r\n\r\nOne obvious area for me is learning more about SVG. It would be nice to reach a point where any graphic that isn’t a photo could be created in CSS or SVG. I’d quite like to move away from icon font libraries in favour of SVGs to reduce a bit of bloat.\r\n\r\nThe other big area is responsive web design, in particular responsive images. Sending large images to mobile devices is bad news and should be a quick win on the performance front.\r\n\r\nI’m sure there will be a lot more that crops up in 2015 as I find a need for it and I may even start learning things that haven’t even been created yet.\r\n\r\nI hope I can help others to learn more too in 2015.",

    "post_content": "Forgotten Your Password? Yes. Yes, I have forgotten my password. Yes, again.\r\n\r\nI always forget my passwords and have to click the forgotten your password link. I resent the wording of “forgotten your password?” as it implies that I’m the one at fault. Gimme a break! The truth of the matter is that as a website user I can’t win. If I pick a nice simple combination of letters and maybe numbers that I can remember easily I’m told that it’s not secure enough; if I pick something suitably complicated or random then I can’t remember it, especially when I’m not supposed to use the same password across multiple sites.\r\n\r\nWe want our accounts to be secure and, at the same time, we want the convenience of not having to jump through a multitude of hoops just to log in.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the option of picking a simple, memorable password isn’t even an option any more. Your password now has to contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, a number and a symbol. How long before you have to type it in blindfolded while standing on one leg?\r\n\r\nSo, what actually happens, every time, is that I have 3 or 4 attempts to guess what password I might have used before having to click the forgotten password link. This goes to a new screen which asks me for my email address, again, even though I’ve just tried it several times. I then wait for an email to arrive before clicking a link in the message to back to a screen where I can reset my password. I type in some new soon to be forgotten combination and I’m finally in, usually about 5 minutes after I started. Several times I’ve either run out of time or decided what ever I wanted to do just isn’t worth the hassle.\r\n\r\nSome very secure systems make you change your password every month. Oh thanks. Yeah, that’s helping. And don’t even think about going back to a password you’ve used before. Does anyone really change their password properly each month or do they just increment one digit making it really easy to guess from one month to the next?\r\n<h3>Keys?</h3>\r\nEntering a password is fundamentally just me proving my identity by giving a piece of information, a combination of letters, numbers and symbols that nobody else could know. I have something unique which grants me access.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of life we approach gaining access differently. We secure our precious homes using a physical key. We actually put a piece of metal into a door and turn it, as we have for centuries. It seems quite crude for the 21st century but it’s simple and it works. We can spend our money by using a physical card and entering a four digit PIN. The PIN is easy to remember - it’s only four digits and you can keep the same digits for years. It’s the combination of something physical and a very simple password which makes it secure and easy.\r\n\r\nWhy’ve we made gaining online access to things so different? I’m not saying we should all have keys for our devices but an element of the physical could certainly come into play. If our web devices had the ability to read from something physical then we could use the same approach. Hackers would not be able to replicate the physical aspect quickly enough to make it viable to hack.\r\n<h3>Partial Solutions</h3>\r\nSo, what’s the answer? There is software which will remember passwords for you. Most decent web browsers offer to remember passwords and there are other programs or apps which will allow you access your password list once you enter a master password. The problem with these is that they’re specific to one device and that’s just not necessarily how we do things now. During a typical day I’ll use a work desktop PC, a laptop, a phone and a tablet and I may want to access the same info from any of them.\r\n\r\nThe closest I’ve seen to an automated solution is to use the same browser across all devices, assuming this is possible, and allow it to remember and sync passwords. Chrome and Firefox offer this. As far as I know the passwords are not stored in the cloud but actually within the browser on each device. My worry is that a site or app could try to imitate the sync process and steal all your password data. I’m sure it’s pretty secure but anything that stores passwords is going to get the attention of hackers.\r\n\r\nHow about writing down all your passwords in a notebook? Sounds stupid at first but as there aren’t hoards of bad guys actively trying to steal it it’s probably one of the safer options. The difficulty is keeping it with you and never losing it. It could fall into the wrong hands and easily expose you to problems from people not clever enough to be hackers.\r\n\r\nI think the key to balancing security and convenience is to weigh up how secure access to a site needs to be and how often you use it. Think “if someone got in what’s the worst they could they do?”. With the convenient “forgotten your password” service provided by most sites, if someone has your email address and password they can actually get into pretty much everything.\r\n<h3>Guard your Email</h3>\r\nTreat your email address as top priority. Choose a horrible, hard to remember password and make the effort to learn it. Don’t use this password for anything else. If you log into the email provider’s site or app, don’t let your browser or device remember the password - make the effort to type it in each time.\r\n<h3>Get Creative with your Passwords</h3>\r\nFinally, some fun things you can do to make seemingly random combinations more memorable. None of this is particularly new and won’t fool any serious hackers but it might help meet the increasingly tough password requirements for day to day stuff.\r\n<h3>Use numbers and symbols as letters</h3>\r\nE99$he11 (eggshell)\r\n£1ephan+ (elephant)\r\n+or+o!5e (tortoise)\r\nD@r+hV@der (DarthVader)",

    "post_content": "A look at why and how I use Codepen for front end development work.\r\n<h3>Background</h3>\r\nI work on a web app with a development team. We use <a href=\"https://angularjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">AngularJS</a> with a RESTful API. My role is looking at the design and UX side of things and scoping out how a new feature will look and behave in a web browser, or, I should say, in various browsers at different screen sizes.\r\n\r\nI generally do my work up front. I've always been a design in HTML and CSS kind of guy. To me, with my skill set, working in a graphics editor takes as long as coding it so it makes little sense for me to do the work twice.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, I've been using static HTML and then another developer has added the binding and data. Where the feature is on a new screen I can go a step further and create a dummy data object, to represent the data returned from the API, and actually do the binding as well as create any custom behaviour.\r\n\r\nWorking on existing screens has been much more difficult. It's almost impossible to add new data, binding and behaviours without breaking the existing code. To use a dummy data object I need to intercept the real data retrieval and replace the object, which stops the page working when wired up again. However I work things, I'm having to check in code which is not releasable.\r\n<h3>A new way of working</h3>\r\nI've started using <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a> to abstract away the new feature. I set up a new pen, import any existing dependencies and then create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the new feature in isolation.\r\n\r\nThis means that the original project code does not get touched and broken. As the next developer brings in any model/schema changes he/she can bring in my front end code so we don't have any breaking check-ins.\r\n\r\nBy importing the dependencies - JavaScript libraries, CSS - we avoid any clashes or inheritance issues and additional work trying to integrate my code.\r\n\r\nIt also means I can give the new feature my full attention without having to use other parts of the screen, for example, if I'm working on a modal window, I don't have to go through the usual page processes in order to call it.\r\n\r\nI'm using <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a> in the way it was intended, as a front end playground, an environment where I can experiment with different ways of doing things. The results are displayed in a frame, updated instantly as you type, which makes working much faster - no more manual refreshing or rebuilding.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've described up to this point, this abstraction could be done by making a copy of the page but copying the HTML page, the CSS and JavaScript and changing all of the references between these files is quite a headache. Believe me, I've been there enough times.\r\n\r\nOne of the massive advantages of <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a> for a designer is the ability to fork pens, so you just hit one button and you've got an exact copy of the pen you were working in, making it very easy to create a few variations of a design.\r\n\r\nAs each pen is available on a public URL it's easy to share designs with colleagues or clients and they can see a working prototype - much better than a static screenshot. It also means that links can be embedded in documentation. Personally, I feel that now web animation has become mainstream, it's important to be able to show how screen elements transition between states, how things appear/disappear and demonstrate where the user's attention is drawn through processes. Static screenshots just don't cut it any more.\r\n\r\nFinal point. Designing in the browser with work stored in the cloud is awesome for design. I could be out and about and suddenly see some inspiration for something I'm working on or get a new idea. Rather than hope I'll remember it, I can quickly create a new pen or fork an existing one and add some code or notes there and then from a phone or tablet. I don't have to hope I'll remember or wait until I'm back at my desktop. It's exactly what the web should be.",

    "post_content": "I thought I'd do another quick run-through of what I've picked up this year. It feels good to show myself that I'm still learning at a healthy pace.\r\n<h3>SVG</h3>\r\nI've started using SVG more, creating some simple charts and building dynamic graphics for use with Google Maps. I made markers or pins, which have colours and characters set dynamically according to data. I think I've finally got my head around the whole viewBox, which took me a while. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/search-results/?q=svg\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Tricks</a> provided me with some <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/search-results/?q=svg\" target=\"_blank\">very useful SVG tutorials</a> and introduced me to the work of <a href=\"https://sarasoueidan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sara Soueidan</a>.\r\n<h3>Angular.js</h3>\r\nI've been tinkering with <a href=\"https://angularjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Angular</a> for a while but have really got into using it day-to-day this year. I found it hard at first because it's so different to using native JavaScript or jQuery to manipulate the DOM. In Angular you basically set conditions in the HTML, e.g. show this when the data is that, and then to make things happen you just change the data. The data changes and the UI updates. It means you're not making data changes and UI changes - just change the data and Angular looks after the UI. Once you've got that it's actually a lot easier to manage than writing an app with jQuery.\r\n<h3>React.js</h3>\r\nI've done my first project using <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\">React</a>. This is a very clever framework for updating the UI as quickly as possible. It checks what actually needs to change on screen and only updates the HTML nodes that require a change, making the UI very fast and, well, reactive. It's based on building components which each have their own properties and state. The component or modular approach certainly feels like the way forward for building UIs.\r\n<h3>Jekyll</h3>\r\nI built the previous incarnation of this website using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>. It's a static site generator. It works in much the same way as any content management system with templates and a build process but spits out static HTML so it's faster for the user. It took a lot of setting up on Windows and involved some scary new stuff for me, like Ruby, Python and using the command line. It is an amazing bit of software for building fast sites and very flexible. Definitely worth trying. I eventually moved away from it and back to WordPress as it was just easier to update - I can update from any device anywhere without having to have the complicated local set up. As my content is mainly just text, I didn't feel the performance gains balanced out the usability for me as an author.\r\n<h3>Markdown</h3>\r\nUsing Jekyll also introduced me to using markdown. It's a quick way of writing HTML without having to use tags. It keeps the content clean and easy to read, whilst containing formatting. It kind of lets you write HTML without having to break your creative flow to think about formatting. It also enables non HTML savvy authors to publish formatted content easily.\r\n<h3>New JavaScript Syntax - EcmaScript 6</h3>\r\nI haven't used it yet but started reading about ES6. There are a few good introductory articles, which show off some of the new features without getting too bogged down in the details. Here's a <a href=\"http://www.felixrieseberg.com/ecmascript6-introduction/\" target=\"_blank\">good basic ES6 intro</a>. It feels like a lot to learn but it becomes evident very quickly that we'll be able to write less code and it'll be easier to understand. Win win.\r\n<h3>Google Analytics Event Tracking</h3>\r\nI've used Google Analytics for years but have just discovered how to use event tracking. I can now track clicks on a particular UI element to see how it's used, check pre-defined user preferences by reading data out of the browser's localStorage, measure download numbers for PDF documents. It's opening the doors to a lot of previously missing data with regards to user behaviour and can help me make better decisions on designing the user experience.\r\n<h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>\r\nI've made big strides forward this year with responsive design. I'm starting, late I know, to think about it in everything I do. It's a lot more work but leads to much more usable UIs and often forces me to keep the design simpler than I would otherwise, which is probably a good thing.\r\n<h3>Bootstrap</h3>\r\nI've actively avoided <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a> for the last few years. I always had 2 major concerns with it: 1) that my sites would end up looking the same as everyone else's and 2) that I was loading up a hefty framework and then only using a fraction of it, which would be very wasteful.\r\n\r\nA colleague reintroduced me to it and I was delighted to find that it's now possible to <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/customize/\" target=\"_blank\">create customised builds</a> so you can choose the parts you want to include (no waste) and even set colour schemes, default padding, etc. in the build, replacing the defaults, so there's less needed to overwrite in a custom theme.\r\n\r\nI've started using it as its grid layout makes responsive design so much easier than handling each page element and I know that the ready made components and UI elements are accessible where my own might not be.\r\n<h3>Codepen</h3>\r\nAnd finally, <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a>. I've covered this in another post, <a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/developing-in-codepen/\" target=\"_blank\">Developing in Codepen</a>. In short, I use it every day, it's awesome.",

    "post_content": "I'm a big fan of playing fantasy football, in particular the official <a href=\"http://fantasy.premierleague.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fantasy Premier League</a>, which is focused on the highest level of football or soccer in England. For many of us it's the closest thing we get to being a football manager - analysing the game and picking our teams each week.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking I feel I'm pretty good at it too. Not brilliant, certainly nowhere near winning anything but consistently respectable. I generally finish around the 100,000 mark which doesn't sound like much of an achievement but out of 3.5 million that's pretty good going.\r\n\r\nThis season. Disaster. With 10 games to go I'm still outside the top million. It's been the worst season I've ever had, and by some way. There is light at the end of the tunnel though. I think I'm realising where I've gone wrong and am starting to put it right. I've now done well for 3 weeks in a row and have been on the rise.\r\n\r\nHere's where I've been going wrong...\r\n<h3>Stats</h3>\r\nThis season I've spent more time than ever analysing the stats - looking at which players are having shots, shots in the box, shots on target, etc. I've used this as a basis for my team selection. This seems quite reasonable but stats can be deceptive. A player can have lots of shots appear to be a real threat whereas if you actually watch a game you can see that the player in question was never any real threat whatsoever - the centre half marked him out of the game and blocked every attempted shot with ease.\r\n<h3>Listening to Others</h3>\r\nI've been watching or listening to the weekly chat between the guys at the <a href=\"http://www.fantasyfootballscout.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Fantasy Football Scout</a> site. Their podcast or <a href=\"http://fantasyfootballscout.libsyn.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scoutcast</a> is very entertaining and enjoyable and I've often allowed myself to be led into making transfers on the back of one of them advocating it.\r\n<h3>Fixtures</h3>\r\nI think I've put too much faith in sides being at home. This season more sides seem to be playing a more counter-attacking game and actually seem to do better away from home. When a side is not doing so well and come under fire from their own fans its often easier for them to play away from home.\r\n<h3>History</h3>\r\nMy final realisation is that I've put too much faith in what has happened in the past. I tend to pick players who have done well for me in previous seasons rather than look towards the new emerging talent. Previous seasons' performances influence price and a high price is no guarantee of point scoring.\r\n<h3>Back to Basics</h3>\r\nMy tactic in the past was never any of the above. I'd make my decisions based on watching games. You can easily see which players look a threat going forwards or solid at the back. You take less notice of the actual score and think more about what the score might have been. You see who is putting in the crosses, taking set pieces, who deserved their fantasy points and who just got lucky that week.\r\n\r\nNext season...",

After completing a CodeSchool course I've created several templates which have gone into production.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>JavaScript</h2>\r\nI tend to write <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong> whenever possible as it's compatible with any framework and as frameworks come and go remains constant. I've recently learned parts of <strong>ES2015</strong> and use <strong>TypeScript</strong> to make JavaScript type safe.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>JavaScript Frameworks and Tools</h3>\r\nThe list of frameworks, libraries and tools gets longer all the time. Day to day I work with <strong>Angular</strong> (1). I've known <strong>jQuery</strong> for a long time including the <strong>jQuery UI</strong> front end framework for things like datepickers, autocomplete, sortable lists, drag and drop. I've done projects using <strong>Knockout</strong> and <strong>React</strong>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOther JavaScript based tools I've worked with include <strong>Google Maps API</strong>, <strong>Google Charts API</strong>, <strong>Charts.js</strong>, <strong>Dragula </strong>(drag and drop), <strong>Moment.js </strong>(date/time), <strong>Hopscotch</strong> (inline help), <strong>Toastr</strong> (notifications), <strong>Elevate Zoom</strong> (image zooming).\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>CSS</h2>\r\nI've used CSS for a long time, moving towards the preprocessor <strong>Sass</strong> (SCSS) in more recent years.\r\n<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>\r\nI've worked with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> on several projects as well as one using Google's <strong>Material</strong>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\r\nI use a tool called aXe which validates HTML and CSS against WCAG standards. It can be used as a browser extension or as a Visual Studio extension providing warnings of any accessibility violations.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>Media</h2>\r\nI regularly use different fonts, mainly from <strong>Google Fonts</strong> and make heavy use of <strong>Font Awesome</strong> icon font, although the latest version has moved to SVG.\r\n\r\nI've learned <strong>SVG</strong> and use it wherever possible to give sharp looking graphics at any resolution. I use <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> to work with SVG and export graphics in different formats and resolutions.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Code Editors</h2>\r\nMy main tool is <strong>Visual Studio</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Team Foundation Server</strong> and I use both <strong>Source Control</strong> and <strong>Git</strong>. I tend to do a lot of front end work in <strong>CodePen</strong> as it allows for quick editing, forking and sharing of front end code.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<h2>Testing</h2>\r\nI've done a limited amount of <strong>unit testing</strong> using <strong>Jasmine</strong> and <strong>Karma</strong>. I regularly test web content <strong>cross browser</strong> using <strong>BrowserStack</strong>.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Languages</h2>\r\nFrench\r\n\r\nItalian",

With the web you have to do the same but there's a whole lot more to it.\r\n\r\nWith print, the publication has a fixed size. With <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web design</a>, the size of the page can vary. Imagine trying to paint a picture when your canvas keeps changing size. Users view web pages through different devices and different software with different screen resolutions. Most web pages are still viewed on a computer screen but these days can equally be viewed on mobile phones, PDAs, web books, even games consoles. In terms of software, the main web browsers are <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Firefox</a> but there is a whole host of others. You may have heard of <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?p=41\" target=\"_self\">Chrome</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\" target=\"_blank\">Safari</a>, <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Opera</a> and beyond that mobile devices use their own. Each web browser is a program designed to interpret and display web page code (<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">HTML</a>) but they all interpret it slightly differently so when writing the code you have to be sure it will display as you want it to. As well as conventional web browsers there are also specialised screen readers which read the text on a web page aloud for those with visual impairments. This is where <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">accessible design</a> comes into play. As if that wasn't enough to contend with, individual users also have different screen resolutions, some viewing the same content on a screen resolution 4 times larger than others.\r\n\r\nAreas of the screen can be stretched or squashed to fit with the screen size and, rather than being given fixed heights and widths, are given maximum and minimum dimensions within which they can move.\r\n\r\nSo, when you look at a web page, you need to realise that what you see will probably not be exactly the same as what others see. The content should be the same but the layout will vary.\r\n\r\nAs people buy newer computers with larger monitors and higher resolutions <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">websites</a> need to be <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">redesigned</a>. The majority of users in the UK use a Windows PC with Internet Explorer 7 and a screen resolution of 1024x768 pixels. Three years ago the typical UK user would have been using Internet Explorer version 6 with a screen resolution of only 800x600 pixels. If you haven't <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">redesigned your website</a> in the last 3 years it's time it was optimised for the new generation of visitors.",

So, pretty clear. What's the first thing that people do? Yes, they ignore the signs and sit on them. Every single time I fly, without exception, I've witnessed this. And I'm not talking about young children who sit down and are immediately called back by their families. It's either children who are allowed or even encouraged to sit on them, or adults who consider the rule unworthy of their respect.\r\n\r\nI'm partly irritated by the lack of respect for the rules (bit square, I know) but more aggravated by the attitudes of those who make them. Are the airports genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of their customers or are they just covering themselves legally?\r\n\r\nYou see the same in public washrooms with signs saying Caution - Boiling Hot Water. Rather than cover yourselves against being sued by providing a warning, why not actually address the potential problem and reduce the water temperature. It will probably save you money too long term.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the airport example, why not provide seating facing the carousel so passengers can sit while they wait for their luggage?\r\n\r\nRant over. :)",

Without even seeing it for myself I'm questioning its usability. Is that normal?\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand it's kind of a dating service where the user is shown photos of other users in his/her vicinity. The idea is you then basically accept or reject each and if 2 users accept each other something happens - I don't know what - they didn't talk about that bit. I'd guess some kind of notification or they go through to the next round or, at least, some kind of progress. Anyway, the point here, and the bit these conversations have focused on, is the design of the basic accept or reject user actions. Apparently you swipe left for one and right for the other and users are getting confused. They either forget which is which (I'm sure there are some visual cues so assume they must be going very fast), or they try to go back to a previous one and reject them (I guess that swipe left is probably reject then?).\r\n\r\nMy immediate thought was why not make the left and right swipe simply the means of navigating between photos and make swiping up and down the reject and accept actions? It seems more logical to me that a swipe up is pushing the photo away - reject - and that a swipe down is pulling it towards you - accept.\r\n\r\nThere you go. In my head I've redesigned the UX for an App I've never seen.",

    "post_content": "In the last couple of years I've changed the way I work with colours in websites. I've realised that the number of colours available to us as designers or developers is actually kind of ridiculous and that we're making life harder than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nWhether you use RGB(A) or Hexidecimal notation the number of colours available, if I've worked it out correctly, is:\r\n<blockquote>256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216 colours</blockquote>\r\nThat's a lot of colours.\r\n\r\nWhilst having so many colours available for display is brilliant for viewing high quality photos or creating super smooth gradients, we just don't need to work at that level when assigning colours in our day to day work.\r\n\r\nI've moved to using short form Hex codes, e.g. #fff, for everything. It's not like this leaves you short of choice. In fact, there are still a cool 4,096 colours to pick from, which is more than enough to make my brain hurt.\r\n<blockquote>16 x 16 x 16 = 4,096 colours</blockquote>\r\nI've even gone a stage further and replaced old long form Hex colours with the my new found short form. It's just a case of rounding the values up or down to their nearest whole increment. Values 0-7 are rounded down, 8-f are rounded up. So, #5ba546 becomes #6a4. Can you tell the difference?\r\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; width: 30%; background-color: #5ba546; color: #fff; margin-right: .5em; padding: .5em;\">#5ba546</div>\r\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; width: 30%; background-color: #6a4; color: #fff; padding: .5em; margin-bottom: 1em;\">#6a4</div>\r\nMaybe you can tell the difference seeing them side by side. Would you feel confident you could tell me which one it was if I only showed you the one? Does it matter anyway?\r\n\r\nI would argue that the colour specified and the colour actually seen are never an exact match. A device's display settings - brightness, number of colours, saturation, warmth, etc. can vary so much that is a true colour even really a thing any more? It's more the relationship to other colours that matters than the representation of a single colour on its own.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't say there are major gains to be had by shortening the Hex codes but any removal of unnecessary complexity has to be a good thing, right? It's less characters to type - hardly a major victory - but, more importantly, quite a lot easier to remember each colour, which means that we type the right thing from memory more often and don't have to spend so much time referring back to style guides for commonly used colours.\r\n\r\nSo, which is it, #5ba546 or #6a4?\r\n<div style=\"display: inline-block; width: 30%; background-color: #6a4; color: #fff; padding: .5em; margin-bottom: 1em;\">#?</div>",

The visitor types in a word or series of words which are then used to filter database results or web pages and return a list of matching results. It's a quick and easy way of finding something without having to drill down through endless options.\n\nFrom the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a>'s point of view it's a great tool which increases a website's usability. From the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web marketer</a>'s point of view it can do more.\n\nBy capturing the text typed into the search box the website owner can see what his/her visitors are searching for. This may be for existing products or it could be that they are searching for something not offered. Capturing and analysing this information can help have several benefits.\n\nIt can show where perhaps the wrong keywords are being used. It's unwise to advertise the services of a \"Heating Engineer\" when everybody is searching for a \"plumber\". Finding the right keywords allows you to change your text and tags and bring you closer to your potential customers.\n\nIt can help to shape a website's navigation. If a particular area is of far greater interest than others it can be made more prominent on the site. You may even notice seasonal trends.\n\nWhere the search text is for products or services not offered by the website it brings the opportunity of developing the product/service range or working with partners to deliver these to the website visitor.\n\nTo effectively capture this kind of data you need to not only log the text eneterd into the search box but also the time, date and the user's IP address. This additional information allows you to spot any duplicate results - there's a big difference between one person searching for something ten times and ten people searching for something once. The date and time data allows you to see any seasonal trends or possible responses to any other marketing campaigns.\n\nEven on a small website, which wouldn't normally merit a search box, using this tool can provide you quickly and easily with details of what your website visitors want.",

I don't feel it's morally right to invest my time and a customer's money in something that is doomed to failure.\n\nIt's not that people have bad ideas, it's just that they don't have a business plan. I think most of us know that most new businesses fail in their first year and online businesses are no different. All too often people see having a website as the answer when it's only part of a larger process. I get the feeling that people still believe that they can spend money on a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">new website</a> and then sit back and wait for the orders to come in.\n\nWhilst having your own <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">ecommerce site</a> or <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">online business</a> is appealing it is a big initial investment for a new business and you should consider how many sales you'd need to cover the cost. If you can't be sure that you can recover this cost within a reasonable timescale you shouldn't take the risk.\n\nThere are other ways. I often advise people starting out on a new venture to start off selling through <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a>. You pay a nominal amount to list your products and have to give eBay a percentage of your revenue but this is a lot cheaper and less risky than shelling out for a website. After a time, if you feel that there is a proven market and that you can make a profit then you can look at running your own site. Hopefully, if things have gone well, you'll have a bit of money in the bank to invest too.",

    "post_content": "I thought I'd share a challenge I'm facing at the moment. A lot of modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular encourage building reusable UI components. Using JavaScript and HTML templates seems like an excellent approach to development on larger sites but styling these components can bring a few issues.\r\n\r\nBrowsers can handle styling standard HTML web components, like &lt;select&gt; or &lt;button&gt;. They may vary in how they display these but they all have a default way which can then be overwritten with CSS. This is stored as a kind of internal CSS class in the browser and is easy to overwrite as it has almost zero specificity. Adding an element selector 'select', a class '.picker' or an id '#picker' will easily take control over the styling.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises when we create custom components that don't have any default, zero specificity styling. Any styling that we do add when we design components has specificity so we immediately have a fight on our hands for which styling declaration gets control. We need some level of default styling, usually for layout as much as anything, to ensure that the browser cannot just show a mess of HTML elements.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of how default component styling could be set and the problems associated with each approach.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3>Setting the CSS in an external stylesheet</h3>\r\nWe set the styling in its own CSS file. I'd say that this is the approach used by most UI tools like Bootstrap or jQuery UI. Various HTML elements in the component are given classes, which can be overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that they can only be overwritten by using higher specificity or by making sure that the overwriting style comes after the external CSS in the document's source order. It also means an additional HTTP request to load a usually small amount of styling data.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3>Setting the style in a style attribute</h3>\r\nWe could add style attributes directly into the HTML tags. The problem here is obvious - super high specificity. This makes the styling very difficult to overwrite. You're pretty much forced into using '!important' declarations in your CSS, which not only feels wrong but really leaves you with nowhere to go.\r\n\r\nIt goes against the separation of concerns - content and styling but as this is intended to be default styling, which we would hope to overwrite, I'm not sure this matters.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3>Setting the style in a HTML &lt;style&gt; tag</h3>\r\nWe could place a block of HTML with &lt;style&gt; tags directly before or after the component HTML so that it effectively ships together. Placing &lt;style&gt; tags in the &lt;body&gt; was invalid in HTML4 but, if I've understood it correctly, can be used in HTML5 by using the scoped attribute, e.g. &lt;style type=\"text/css\" scoped&gt;&lt;/style&gt;. Browser support for this to be properly valid is not great at the time of writing (early 2016) - we get warning messages in consoles or code editors - but it seems to display as intended.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that the style is declared in the &lt;body&gt; whereas the overwriting CSS is probably declared in the &lt;head&gt; and so will not overwrite it without upping the specificity.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html\" target=\"_blank\">W3C Recommendation - Stylesheets\r\n</a><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/style.html#style.attrs.scoped\" target=\"_blank\">W3C Recommendation - Style Scoped</a></li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3>Setting the style with JavaScript</h3>\r\nThe final option is to set styling using JavaScript, which effectively just inserts style attributes into the component's HTML elements like in approach 2.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI'm wondering if there may be a solution where we have a default styles object which defines style properties in our existing component JavaScript file. We then check to see what styling is applied using the browser's getComputedStyle() function. For each of the properties we check if a rule is already set, presumably by CSS that is in the &lt;head&gt;, and if not we apply the style from the object. It's almost like required validation for styling. I don't imagine it's going to be very efficient but it may be a way of ensuring a minimum level of styling without restricting additional styling via CSS. Assuming that our script file is at the end of the &lt;body&gt;, by using only the existing resources we could save an additional HTTP request.",

Here are a few ways to help spoil the spammers' fun.\n\n<strong>Email Spam</strong>\n\nThere are a lot of anti-spam or spam filter products around these days, many included in mail software but the sad fact is that once you're getting spam you're likely to keep getting spam regardless of these filters.\n\nSpammers are able to change the sender's email address, subject and body of an email so easily that if you block them they can still mail you just using a different mail account.\n\nAnti-spam software like anti-virus software can only deal with what it knows to be harmful or unwanted. Anything new or unknown will slip through the net.\n\nThe way to avoid spam is never to let your email address get into the wrong hands. Once a spammer has got your email address they can not only use it to send you junk email but also sell it on to other spammers. Once you're address is out there you've no hope of keeping the spam at bay.\n\nIf we understand how the spammers get our email addresses we can avoid them.\n\n<strong>Unscrupulous Websites\n</strong>\nThis is an obvious one but when giving your email address as part of registration on a website be careful to check the terms and conditions or privacy policy as you may be agreeing to have your details passed to a third party. You just have to judge carefully how trustworthy you think the site is.\n\n<strong>Unwanted Newsletters</strong>\n\nAt times it can be risky signing up to newsletters by email. Even though they offer you the option to unsubscribe at ay time they may also subscribe you to other similar newsletters without your express permission. You might sign up to receive newsletters from one site and start receiving them from another related site. Often where companies own several websites with subscription services they can try to cross-promote. Check the terms and conditions or privacy policy carefully.\n\n<strong>Harvesting Web Pages</strong>\n\nThis is a common process used to gather email addresses. Robots trawl through websites looking for email addresses and feeding them back to the spammer. In short, never give an email address on a web page. Instead use a contact form which delivers the message to your inbox without ever revealing the address.\n\n<strong>Guessing Common Recipient Names</strong>\n\nMany spammers will not even try to find email addresses but will just try their luck at guessing them. If they know the domain name and send emails to info@ or sales@ there's a good chance some of them will get through. If you try to use email addresses that are less obvious you shouldn't get as much spam.\n\n<strong>Email Scams</strong>\n\nAt one time or another you've probably had an email from a friend or colleague with some \"too good to be true\" offer or superstitious nonsense. These scams are easy to spot as they usually ask you to forward the message to a certain number of people and CC a particular email address.\n\nThe offers are never real. What is actually happeneing is the spammers are relying on people's naivety to spread the email. Each time the email is forwarded to 10 people the spammer will get an email back (the CC address) and have 10 new email addresses to add to his/her spam database.\n\nThe difficulty with this is that to a certain degree it's beyond your control. You just need to make sure that you're never taken in by these scams and do your best to make your friends and colleagues aware of this scamming technique so that you don't appear on their forwarding list.\n\n<strong>Forms and Blogs</strong>\n\nContact forms, blogs and other Web 2.0 applications invite visitors to a webpage to leave comments or provide feedback. Spammers see this a an opportunity to leave spam messages usually containing links to their websites.\n\nComments can often be set so that they have to be moderated and manually approved by the owner before being published but even then huge amounts of spam can become a problem with moderation becoming unmanageable.\n\nThere are two answers to this - use clever scripting to fool spam robots or use a <a title=\"captcha\" href=\"http://www.recaptcha.net\" target=\"_blank\">CAPTCHA</a> control in your page.\n\nSpam robots visit pages and look for opportunities to enter content. They cannot do things that a human user can do such as answer questions or interpret images. By forcing the page visitor to act like a human in order to leave a message we can reduce spam to only that manually left by real people.\n\nSpam robots can easily be fooled by using fake fields in a form. Include a field for some bit of information you don't actually need and hide it using CSS. Only allow the message to be left if the field is blank. The spam robot will complete it.\n\nYou've probably come across <a title=\"captcha\" href=\"http://www.recaptcha.net\" target=\"_blank\">CAPTCHA</a> controls but may not know them by this name. You're shown a fuzzy image containing a word or letters and numbers and then asked to type the characters into a text field. Spam robots can't do this.\n\nIf you're having problems with spam coming from your website ask your <a title=\"web developer\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> to use some of these measures and you should see a difference within a short time.\n\n<strong>6 Quick Tips\n</strong>\n1. Never open spam emails - if in doubt, delete it\n2. Never reply to spam emails - you're just confirming delivery\n3. Never forward suspicious emails - don't spread the problem\n4. Check terms or privacy policy when giving your email address\n5. Never publish an email address on a web page\n6. Use scripting or a CAPTCHA control on web forms - don't allow spam robots to post",

    "post_content": "Over the last couple of months of 2015 and the start of 2016 I decided to redesign this site. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it before from a user's point of view but from an author's point of view I felt I could do better.\r\n\r\nThe site was built using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>, which is a static site generator. You make changes on your local machine and everything gets rebuilt as static files. This is great for performance as static pages are much faster. The downside for me was that it meant only being able to publish blog posts or pages from that one machine. #firstworldproblems :)\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with having my own site is giving it the love it deserves. Making time to write content is definitely the number one blocker for me. If I could make it as easy as possible to write content from multiple devices that would go a long way to making it work for me. I decided to go back to good old <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>.\r\n\r\nI now publish from my laptop as before but, as it's all web based, I can just log on anywhere and write a draft. The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-Display-Wi-Fi-GB-Includes/dp/B00Y3TM6CO\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Fire tablet</a> (forked Android) has a WordPress app which allows me to write locally and sync at my convenience. I don't think I'd really choose to write blog posts from my phone but if I ever needed to make a change, e.g. spotted an embarrassing typo, I could.\r\n\r\nAs a developer using something built on PHP and MySql is nowhere near as cool as Ruby and no database but who actually cares. Loads of great sites I use day-to-day are built on WordPress, like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Tricks</a>. If it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me.\r\n\r\nAdding or customising themes is very simple. I'm using the default <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen/\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty Fifteen</a> theme but have added my own little child theme to customise it beyond just colours and image background choices. I'm using a Google Font called <a href=\"https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anton\" target=\"_blank\">Anton</a> for headings plus I've changed some of the spacing and played with the perspective of the sidebar.\r\n\r\nThe vibrant pink hasn't changed.",

    "post_content": "What's the best way of loading more items on screen in terms of user experience and performance - \"infinite\" scroll, pagination or a simple \"load more\" option? Here's a quick look and pros and cons of each.\r\n<h3>Infinite Scroll</h3>\r\nInfinite scroll is the name given to a web design pattern where scrolling to the bottom of the screen loads more records. It's most common in streams like on Facebook and Twitter.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pros</strong>\r\nDone well it's a nice seemless flow, moving very smoothly from one set of items to the next.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cons</strong>\r\nIt can be hard to navigate back up the list. Having so many items on screen at once can be confusing and slow everything down. The list has to be loaded in order - it's not possible to skip to the end. It's not infinite - there is always a finite number of records - just a pet hate of mine.\r\n<h3>Pagination</h3>\r\nPagination is the practice of breaking a large list down into pages and only showing a fixed number of records at a time. It typically has links at the bottom to navigate between pages and previous and next links. It often features text to help explain what is being shown, e.g. \"Showing records 21-40 of 165\".\r\n\r\n<strong>Pros</strong>\r\nIt's very clear. The user is not presented with too much information at once. This keeps the DOM light and the screen fast. The user knows where he/she is in the list and can make an educated guess on jumping to other pages. If the list is in alphabetical order and has 10 pages, you can assume that something beginning with M will be roughly in the middle, page 5 or 6.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cons</strong>\r\nSeeing that there are lots of pages can be off-putting.\r\n<h3>Load More</h3>\r\nThe Load More option is like Infinite Scroll but instead of automatically loading more as the user scrolls down you offer a button or link to load the next set of items. This is commonly seen at the end of image search lists.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pros</strong>\r\nIt puts the user in control - they don't accidentally load content they don't really want using up bandwidth on mobile. It doesn't give a sense of how much data there is in the pipeline so doesn't scare the user away from loading more.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cons</strong>\r\nSometimes not having a sense of the number of records can be a bad thing. As with Infinite Scroll, the list has to be loaded in order - it's not possible to skip to the end.",

    "post_content": "I've worked on a few education sites in Wales and bilingualism is one of the major challenges for any public sector site.\r\n\r\nA multilingual site isn't so hard. Most content management systems offer language switching - being on a page in one language and hopping across to view the equivalent piece of content in another. The difficulty comes with entering the site or managing the landing page experience.\r\n\r\nSo, on your bilingual site, what do you put on your home page? Most content management systems are set up to use a default or primary language with others as secondary options. They're not treated equally. In Wales we're supposed to give both Welsh and English equal status.\r\n\r\nAt one point I toyed with the idea of having bilingual pages - a 2 column layout with the 2 versions side by side. This is common in print and it works pretty well. On web pages it's not so easy. Space can be very limited, especially on mobile. Loading and displaying additional content that will not be consumed is not really practical. It halves the value of your site - that's value in real monetary terms if you're paying for data downloaded. The other main point is that web pages just don't work that way. A page needs to have a language set so that it can be searched and indexed by search engines. As soon as we mix languages, we're probably killing any potential search rankings.\r\n\r\nI've come up with a possible solution. I'm not sure it would work in all cases but for the school website I'm working on now it seems to tick all the boxes. I use a Splash Page. It's normal use would be for special promotions. It's a screen which interrupts your browsing before allowing you to continue to your usual entry page. Rather than a static promotional message I'm reading in the title of the target page in both languages and presenting them as options. So, the user chooses whether to continue in Welsh or English. Now, here's the clever bit. The user's language preference is stored in the browser (localStorage) and is used on future visits. If a preference has been set then the Splash Page will not appear again on that browser, within a specified time frame.\r\n\r\nUsing this Splash Page means that the user is never presented with a monolingual page without having first made a choice. We have achieved equality for both languages whilst not harming our search engine rankings. :)",

    "post_content": "One of the areas of front end development I've really got into in the last year or so is performance. It's always been there in the background (along with SEO and accessibility) but it seems to have a lot more focus in the web community lately.\r\n\r\nFor a while I've been looking at different ways to speed up various sites I work on. This site has given me a perfect guinea pig for trying out some different techniques. Let's give it a boost! Oooosh!\r\n<h3>Static</h3>\r\nMy first idea for making this site super fast to load was to make all of the pages static. I started off by just making a few pages but soon realised that as things grew and I wanted to make design changes it just wasn't scalable. It was fast though. If I was building a simple site with only a handful of pages this is the way to go.\r\n<h3>Jekyll</h3>\r\nTo try to get the best of both worlds, static for speed and CMS for convenience, I moved on to using <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator. After jumping through a lot of hoops I got it set up. It works really well and if you're planning to update a site from a single machine I'd say this is the perfect solution.\r\n<h3>WordPress</h3>\r\nFor various reasons I moved back to good old uncle <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>. It's so easy to update from anywhere, which means I actually do it, plus I feel that it's become so big in the web industry (almost its own industry) that I can't really afford not to know my way around it.\r\n\r\nSo, my new challenge is to make my WordPress site fast. There are various well renowned caching plugins, e.g. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\" target=\"_blank\">W3 Total Cache</a>, which would effectively turn my PHP into static pages. Unfortunately, these don't seem to work with my <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network\" target=\"_blank\">multisite</a> setup so I've tried something different.\r\n<h3>Cloudflare</h3>\r\nI've routed my site through <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloudflare</a>. It's a website fronting service which aims to improve performance and security. They host your site on various servers around the world so you get the benefits of a CDN - fast delivery to far flung parts of the world. They concatenate and minify static files for you - one less job. They also handle security threats and high spikes in traffic so your site doesn't go down. As if that wasn't enough, they also serve your files over https - cheaper than SSL hosting and great for SEO.\r\n\r\nSo far so great. Definitely worth a look on top of whatever other optimisations you're doing. :)",

    "post_content": "I've done quite a lot of work with the Google Maps JavaScript API in the last year or so. I think I've picked up quite a bit along the way, which you won't find in the official reference guide.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started working with it, one of my favourite things was the excellent documentation that came with it. Sadly, since the shift to Material Design, it's now very difficult to navigate and find anything. In fact, I've pretty much given up on it. It's a lot easier to just use Stack Overflow.\r\n\r\nHere are some fairly basic things I found, which, depending on your project, might make life easier.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use a map object</strong>\r\nUsing an overarching object to hold anything map related - data arrays, functions, etc. really helps when you're using dynamic data or lots of other JavaScript. It's basically just a namespace, package or module.\r\n\r\n<strong>Push overlays into arrays</strong>\r\nWhen you add any overlay, for example a marker or polygon, the normal process is to read the geo data out of an object or array and use it to add the overlays. However, if you then want to interact with those overlays you have no way of selecting them. When you create an overlay push it into an array. That way you can loop through the items or select one by its index.\r\n\r\n<strong>Add key or id property to get an overlay easily</strong>\r\nIn addition to adding an overlay to an array you can give it its own custom property like an id or key so that you can select it without knowing its index. The Google Maps overlay objects, which can have properties like fillColor, map, position, etc. are actually just JavaScript objects so you can add your own properties. You can then use filter() to access an individual overlay from the array or you can alias it with a variable.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use polygons appropriate for zoom range</strong>\r\nIf you define a polygon it will work at any zoom range. For your map usage it's worth considering if you need to allow the full zoom range to be used. It might be easier to limit it. Imagine a polygon for the outline of France. If you're zoomed right out, looking at the world you can get away with just a hexagon shape. If you zoom in close you need to pick out each little twist and turn in the coastline. See what you need and use simplified polygons for speed and performance where possible.\r\n\r\n<strong>Use dynamic SVGs as icons</strong>\r\nYou can use your own image files as markers instead of the standard pin. However, these don't have to be static image files. You can create your own function which takes parameters for colours or values and uses these to return an SVG including these details. You can then set this function as the icon image.\r\n\r\n<strong>Set bounds and extend them</strong>\r\nWhen you create a map, also create a bounds object. This holds location data for the top right (NE) and bottom left (SW) of a box, which determines the portion of the map shown on screen. It manages the zoom level for you. Whenever you add a new overlay to your map you can extend these bounds so that all of your overlays will always be shown.",

I'm not going to explain it as there are other sites that can do a far better job of that but just wanted to share some excellent resources for learning it as painlessly as possible.\r\n\r\nI've delayed on learning it for what feels like years as I've had to support older browsers and trying to provide alternative layouts for old and new was just too much of a maintenance headache. Now I've learned it there's no looking back.\r\n\r\nHere are 3 excellent resources to help learn it. They're all quite different but used together cover everything you could need.\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://flexbox.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Flexbox.io</a></h3>\r\nThis is a series of free video tutorials by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wesbos\" target=\"_blank\">Wes Bos</a>. Each video is short and focuses on one step, which makes it easy to digest. It's very well explained, gives real examples and even details setting up AutoPrefixer to make it more cross browser compatible. I'd say this is the best place to start.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.flexboxdefense.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FlexboxDefense.com</a></h3>\r\nThis site by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChanningAllen\" target=\"_blank\">Channing Allen</a> is a game that gets you to use your flexbox knowledge to position towers to defend against attackers. It's got 10 levels which increase in difficulty.

    "post_content": "The FA Cup is dying. How can it be restored to its former glory?\r\n\r\nThere's no doubt that the FA Cup is struggling. It's been in decline for a number of years with big clubs and their fans looking on it very much as a lower priority after the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. I'd even go as far as saying that it's not third after those 2 tournaments. Finishing in the top 4 and qualifying for next season's Champions League is valued above it. There's currently talk of getting rid of FA Cup replays due to fixture congestion, which shows that it's clearly seen as an inconvenience rather than an opportunity to some clubs.\r\n\r\nSadly, it all comes down to money. The FA Cup games don't have the same international interest and generate the same sort of money from TV rights. The prize money isn't at a level where it makes top clubs stop and take notice. It's a drop in the ocean compared with TV money. So, the answer to reviving the big clubs' interest in the competition lies in creating an incentive for them.\r\n\r\nOne idea that I've heard discussed is giving the winner entry into the Champions League - reducing the top 4 league positions to a top 3 and giving the fourth place to the cup winners. This would certainly create the incentive but a cup competition by its very nature has an element of luck and it would result in weaker teams getting lucky and finding their way into the Champions League, only to find themselves completely out of their depth and knocked out in the first round. Surely, we should have our strongest teams representing us in Europe?\r\n\r\nCould the Premier League TV money, instead of being split into 20 shares, be split into 21 with the last one going to the FA Cup winner? In theory this could be done but would require the agreement of all of the clubs and some may prefer to bank the extra 20th rather than gamble on winning the cup or risk one of their rivals gaining a double share.\r\n\r\nCould the FA cup be worth 3 league points so would give the winner an advantage going into the following season? Teams can be punished for going into administration or fielding ineligible players by having points deducted so why not award points for a positive achievement like best fair play record or winning the cup - carrot instead of stick? I'm sure all clubs would consider this a prize worth fighting for.\r\n\r\nLooking at it another way, is the lack of interest by the bigger clubs, who regularly put out second string teams, a good thing? Does this give smaller clubs the chance of progressing further in the tournament and ever-so-slightly redressing the balance of financial power in the game? Does it give young squad players who spend their lives in the reserves or on the bench a chance to shine?\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that in the end these things have a natural way of sorting themselves out. The closing of one door opens another. If the big clubs and their fans aren't as interested as they once were, it's their loss. Someone else will enjoy their day at Wembley.",

What I do know is that every site I've worked on in the last decade or so has made use of it.\r\n\r\nThe part I feel more confident about guessing is that only a very small minority use anything beyond the most basic out of the box usage. This was true of me until only a few months ago when I was asked if we could track something other than a simple page load.\r\n<h3>Tracking Events</h3>\r\nIt seems like a big thing initially but is actually quite straightforward. You just use any JavaScript event, like a click or change, and send some details to identify it off to Google, all asynchronously. Then it shows up in your reporting. <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/events\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics for Web Event Tracking</a>\r\n\r\nThis almost becomes a consideration in everything you do in JavaScript. Every time a user takes any kind of action in the UI ask if it's worth tracking. It can be incredibly useful for a new site or new feature to understand exactly how things are being used in the wild. I'd say if in doubt, track it, analyse it, then once you know how it works and you're happy with the result stop tracking.",

    "post_content": "How can we make designs feel more like the natural world and less like something created on a machine? Here are a few ideas...\r\n<h3>Randomness</h3>\r\nI've created a few pens on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a> recently which involve JavaScript generating random elements in the DOM. Add a new element and assign it random position, dimensions or scale.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/GoVVPY\" target=\"_blank\">Furball</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/BKaWBd\" target=\"_blank\">Tie Fighter Waves</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/WrzVxw\" target=\"_blank\">Random Circles</a>\r\n\r\nWhilst these were just playing around, I am interested by the idea of bringing an element of randomness into designs. There's a real feeling of the natural world or at least being outside in allowing things to be created and move around of their own accord or, at least, appear to.\r\n<h3>Position</h3>\r\nTo do this we can use JavaScript to assign elements a random position. Set position:absolute and then generate random numbers for left and top values within the confines of the viewport width and height.\r\n<h3>Movement</h3>\r\nIn nature things don't generally move in a linear way. They accelerate, reach their desired speed and then decelerate again before stopping - its not sudden. Similarly, things don't just appear or disappear but gradually fade in or out of view or move in gradually from outside the range of vision. Things don't always stay upright. They turn and sway. They're affected by wind outside.\r\n\r\nKeyframe animation with transforms, especially translate and rotate, can help make things move quite subtly giving a very natural feel.\r\n<h3>Lighting</h3>\r\nLight is not a constant in nature, except maybe in the dessert. It is affected by cloud cover and so the lightness/darkness of things will vary. Shadows don't stay fixed for long but may change direction and intensity outside.",

My instinctive reaction is a mixture of horror and disbelief. I can't remove it quick enough and get some CSS to control it instead.\r\n\r\nThinking about it a little deeper, this tag gets misused a lot. There's a big difference between a semantic break between 2 bits of content and just shifting something down a line because it looks better at the time. The example above using several line breaks consecutively is, to my mind, just plain wrong. A break is used to separate content and its semantic meaning here is trying to separate other breaks.\r\n\r\nTo be fair to the other developers there's a good chance it's some visual editor doing a bad job rather than it being hand coded this way but the result is the same.\r\n\r\nHTML should be about conveying the meaning of the content, not just a way of putting text on screen. Adding gaps or breaks between bits of content needs to be considered too.\r\n<h3>Margin vs Padding</h3>\r\nWe get a similar situation with margin and padding. Some developers just use these interchangeably to put a gap between elements but this feels wrong to me. Even though this is purely styling rather than content and doesn't need to worry about semantics in the same way, it's still a matter of how you view a particular element. If it appeared in another context, would it always have this margin or padding? I think we should be designing chunks of content as independent elements, which can be dropped into a page ready to go without the need for excessive styling for their context.",

This needs to be used in conjunction with the perspective and perspective-origin rules on a parent element. I tend to put this on the html element.\r\n\r\nI like to set the opacity at 1 when elements are close up and fade them down to a lower opacity as they're further away. This gives a very natural feeling of coming into focus or if exaggerated can give the impression of something emerging from a fog.\r\n\r\nExample: <a href=\"http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/BKaWBd\" target=\"_blank\">Tie Fighter Waves</a>\r\n<h3>Rotation</h3>\r\nI quite often use rotation to make 3D objects spin on screen. It would be a shame to go to the trouble of making a 3D object with detail on all sides only to see part of it. Turning it round slowly is an easy way showing it off. Use a keyframe animation for this rotating the object around the Y axis.\r\n\r\n@keyframes spin {\r\n0% { transform:rotateY(0deg); }\r\n100% { transform:rotateY(360deg); }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.spin { animation: spin 5s linear infinite; }\r\n<h3>Shaking</h3>\r\nMaking an object shake is a great way of drawing attention to it or giving the ipression taht something is alive or vibrating like an engine. It's easy to make objects shake using keyframe animations.\r\n\r\n@keyframes shake {\r\n0% { transform:translateX(-2px); }\r\n100% { transform:translateX(2px); }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.shake { animation: shake 100ms linear alternate infinite; }",

    "post_content": "Imagine you're a business owner or marketing bod and you need to get either a new website or you want a redesign of your current, slightly tired looking site. You need to hire a web designer or design agency. How do you tell the good from the bad?\r\n\r\nWeb designers range from the top end agencies who have major international corporations in their portfolios down to someone's neighbour's kid who made a website for someone once. Chances are you want something in between - not paying over the odds and not getting something held together by sticky tape.\r\n<h3>Agency or Freelance Designer</h3>\r\nI'd say your first choice is knowing whether to go with an individual or an agency. Traditionally agencies would cost you more as they had an office with bills and marketing costs whereas an individual might be working from their room. Today, with more home working, those lines are a bit more blurred and some very good agencies might be made up of remote workers. An agency brings some reassurance, that if a particular person is on holiday for 3 weeks, off ill or leaves then there's usually someone else to pick up your work, whereas with an individual you might not have that fallback. By the same token, some designers have very sound fallback plans - working with other designers, passing all relevant access back to the client so it can be picked up by another freelancer. It's really a case of asking the right questions and making sure you feel adequately covered for what you need.\r\n<h3>It's all about how it looks</h3>\r\nLook at what the designers have done previously. Obviously consider if the designs look appealing but look slightly beyond that. Is each design tailored to the content of the site or business it represents or are they trotting out the same template for all their sites? An overuse of templates suggests that they're bashing out sites as quickly as possible for maximum profit rather than really caring about doing a good job.\r\n<h3>Actually, it's not about how it looks</h3>\r\nLooks are one thing but how a site performs for you is much more important. It needs to load quickly and display properly on any device. Some sites have great home page animations or big images which cycle to promote things. Whilst these may look great on a desktop they're a nightmare on a mobile device without WiFi. If a user has to wait 30 seconds for your page to load and then pinch and zoom to read your page, do you think they'll hurry back? Fast loading and appropriate sizing for all devices is essential.\r\n\r\nAsk about page speed and responsive design. If they don't seem to know about this, or view it as an extra, run, run fast, far away. Responsive design is not a \"nice to have\" like it was a few years back, it's critical. Even if you think you'll never have any mobile visitors, 1) you're wrong, by the way, and 2) having a site work on mobile is a key factor in Google's ranking of search results. If it doesn't perform well on mobile Google's search ranking algorithm will lock your site in a dungeon and make it eat nothing but porridge for the rest of its anonymous life. Probably.\r\n<h3>Relationships</h3>\r\nYou also need to consider if you're looking for a one-off piece of work that's signed off and shipped or an ongoing relationship where they will keep working on your site. Make sure you find out costs for any future work - new features or pages or tweaks to existing stuff - even if you don't think you'll need it. It'll give you a good idea of how they operate.\r\n<h3>UK VAT</h3>\r\nThis applies to the UK. I'm not sure quite how Value Added Tax or equivalents work in other territories. If you're a small business, individual, club, etc and not VAT registered yourself it may pay to find a freelance designer who is also not VAT registered as it will save you having to pay an extra 20%. This does imply that they're working at a lower turnover level but for a smaller project this might be a better fit.\r\n<h3>Summary</h3>\r\nTo bring that all together in a nice to do list, ask about the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fallback plans if the designer is not available</li>\r\n\t<li>Use of templates</li>\r\n\t<li>Page loading times, especially on mobile</li>\r\n\t<li>Appearance on different devices</li>\r\n\t<li>Ongoing or future work</li>\r\n\t<li>Are they VAT registered (if relevant)?</li>\r\n</ul>",

    "post_content": "How do you order your CSS properties? There are a few different possible ways that spring to mind:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Sort all properties alphabetically, listing them A-Z</li>\r\n \t<li>Group properties by their meanings, e.g. typographical properties first, then sizing, then shadows, then animations, etc.</li>\r\n \t<li>Random - just added as they occur to the developer.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI started off with them just logged randomly. Then, as I started writing longer style rules, I tried to bring similar items together. Gradually, over a long time, I've realised that the point of this grouping was to make the properties easier to find quickly. These days I always list them A-Z.\r\n<h3>Going A-Z</h3>\r\nAt first it seems a bit obsessive-compulsive to order them in this way but it does make a real difference. I think things probably changed for me when I started working with JavaScript objects and JSON and the browser dev tools naturally ordered the object properties alphabetically. I got used to them being listed this way and learnt to scan these lists in a logical way. With CSS I'm convinced that in a list of 10 or more properties that being able to scan them in order and focus on the makes a huge difference when doing it every few minutes.\r\n<h3>CSS Property Naming</h3>\r\nUsing A-Z ordering has made me realise how much of an opportunity has been missed with the property naming. For example, 'border-top-right-radius' would have been so much better as 'border-radius-top-right' as it would keep all of the 'border-radius' properties together in an alphabetical list. Also, some typographical properties being prefixed with 'font-' and others 'text-' means that they don't get naturally grouped and 'color' seems stranded out on its own. Hopefully, some future incarnation of CSS will allow some aliasing of property names.\r\n<h3>Code Editor Property Sorting</h3>\r\nI use different code editors for different projects but my main day-to-day one is Visual Studio. The <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/\" target=\"_blank\">ReSharper</a> tool, a paid extension, offers some code clean-up options, one of which is to order all CSS properties A-Z. This enables me to go back to code I worked on pre-A-Z and quickly kick it into shape in a couple of clicks. I don't know of any other tools that do this but I'm sure they must exist, my guess would be as extensions/plugins rather than a core feature.",

I think the question I'm really asking is this - isn't UX design just design? The whole UX thing is kind of meaningless. I know, can of worms...\r\n\r\nIn any other industry things get designed but they don't have special titles for designing for the people using the product - that's obvious. I can't imagine that a car designer would be called a driver experience designer. The driver having a positive experience is an inherent part of the design process.\r\n\r\nI guess that the area of UX exists to give some separation from purely aesthetic design. It's about making things easier to use rather than just pretty. I've always seen design as being both. You can't really have one without the other.\r\n\r\nMy other UX gripe is that it's not really a hard skill, not like development work. It's something that anyone can do. It's a blend of common sense, empathy, pretending to forget everything you know and a willingness to fight for what's best for the user not the developer. When trying to come up with the best user experience for, say, a form, I feel the easiest approach is simply to build something, use it a few times, see where the pain points are, develop alternatives, repeat.\r\n\r\nIt's true that with experience you get it right first time more often but you also get that by imitating the big guns - Amazon, Google, Facebook, BBC.

The blueprint style background is a combination of linear gradients and background sizing and positioning.\r\n<h3>Tie Fighter Attack</h3>\r\n[codepen_embed height=500 theme_id=1 slug_hash='EKKeZv' user='chris22smith' default_tab='result' animations='run']\r\nSee the Pen &lt;a href='http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/EKKeZv'&gt;Tie Fighter Attack&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nIn this project the Tie Fighters are much simpler. Each one is actually just a letter H in a sans-serif font with a small circle (border-radius) over the centre of it. I use JavaScript to set a random position within the viewport, randomly scale and rotate each one slightly so they appear less uniform. The movement is just CSS. Each one uses a keyframe animation to increase it's Z position using transform:translateZ(). So, it is generated, animated towards the viewer until the perspective means it's out of sight and then removed from the DOM. I just keep doing this at regular intervals and it gives the appearance of lots of objects moving towards the viewer, just missing. Another effect at play here is the opacity. Each Tie Fighter starts off with 0 opacity and it increases to 1 as they approach giving the appearance of them coming out of a fog becoming clearer as they approach. The final effect is the shooting. A random proportion of the fighters shoot. These are assigned a class and then use a pseudo element to draw a tall thin box below the main fighter. This is invisible but has green box-shadow. This then uses a CSS animation to add a blink effect.\r\n<h3>3D Death Star</h3>\r\n[codepen_embed height=500 theme_id=1 slug_hash='QNYOQQ' user='chris22smith' default_tab='result' animations='run']\r\nSee the Pen &lt;a href='http://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/QNYOQQ'&gt;3D Death Star&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nThis project uses a 3D sphere made up of rotated circles which rotates. It has one static circle inside it, which is achieved by rotating it in the opposite direction. This has a linear gradient to give it a three dimensional feel. The indented weapon part is just another circle placed on the surface with the gradient running in the opposite direction. The stars are positioned randomly using JavaScript and appear in 3 layers. These are rotated against the Death Star to give the impression of movement.\r\n\r\nYou can find lots of great pens in <a href=\"http://codepen.io/mariemosley/\">Marie Mosley</a>'s <a href=\"http://codepen.io/collection/nbGZVv/\" target=\"_blank\">Star Wars collection</a>.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "At the software company where I work, we've started using <a href=\"http://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\">Codepen</a> as a way of producing interactive demos or prototype pages. It's slowly replacing the use of static images or mock-ups. We've started sharing the URLs for these with customers to get their feedback on new features.\r\n\r\nThis could be done by sending them 2 URLs, one for the pen and one for the feedback form, but it's not as good as being able to complete the form whilst viewing the demo content at the same time. I came up with a way of requesting feedback within the pen.\r\n<h3>SurveyMonkey</h3>\r\nI embedded a <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SurveyMonkey</a> survey tracking script within the pen. I amended the pen design slightly to add a sidebar div and then added the SurveyMonkey embed JavaScript block within this, in the HTML pane of the pen. The script had to be here so that it rendered in the right place. I gave this sidebar a fixed width so that we could control how the survey contents appeared. We then had to write the survey in such a way that it didn't require much screen width and that all questions would fit into a sensible minimum screen height. In short, we kept questions short, no lists of 10 radio buttons.\r\n<h3>CrazyEgg</h3>\r\nI decided to also embed <a href=\"http://www.crazyegg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CrazyEgg</a>. If you don't know it, it's a tool that allows you to track mouse clicks. It's a very useful way of knowing which parts of your screen get the most interaction. We added this script into the head content, within the HTML settings. This is a paid service but you can get a free trial for a short time.\r\n<h3>Debug Mode</h3>\r\nThe 2 scripts seemed to get blocked when we tried using the pen in Editor or Full Screen modes but Debug mode, which runs the code as it is without any header or validation, worked like a dream. You need a PRO account to use this mode. Well worth it anyway in my view.\r\n<h3>Feedback Ready</h3>\r\nI'm now looking at building this out as a template ready for future feedback gathering.",

    "post_content": "I've noticed a bit of a recurring theme in UX work with people asking me whether a page element should be hidden from the user or just disabled.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems quite clear cut. If the user isn't going to use the element, hide it. If they can't use it now but may do when conditions are right, disable it.\r\n\r\nA typical example is a form with a Save button. We don't want users to be able to save until the form is valid, completed as we've specified. We could just show and enable the button and then throw validation errors. However, it seems more appropriate to me to simply not make the save option available until it can actually perform its function and save the data. In this case do we hide the button or disable it?\r\n\r\nI'd argue that we disable the Save button. We don't want it to be used now but we want to communicate the possibility of using it in the future. It's useful for a user to see what the next step is going to be.\r\n\r\nIf we hide the button instead of disabling it then the user is confronted with a form and no obvious action. If they think there's no way of progressing they may be reluctant to spend their time filling out the form.\r\n\r\nAnother example might be a Delete button where only certain user roles have permission to delete records. In this case it makes sense to hide the button from users without delete permissions. They will never use it, at least not with their current role on this page load, so showing it as disabled would give the wrong suggestion that they may be able to delete at some point.\r\n<h3>Just Hidden or Never There</h3>\r\nIf we decide that an element will never be used by the current user, maybe due to permissions, then we hide it. However, there's a difference between adding the element into the DOM and hiding it with CSS, like display:none or visibility:hidden and simply not adding it into the DOM. It's better both for security and from a page performance point of view to not add it into the DOM. Conditionally add the element using server side code or, in a front-end framework, use the option which does not add it. For example, in AngularJS this would mean using ngIf rather than ngShow.\r\n<h3>Disabling Links</h3>\r\nAnother issue that comes up is people wanting to disable links. So, there's a link to another page but this option only becomes available to use when certain conditions in the page are met. Should this link be hidden or disabled?\r\n\r\nThis is tougher. By default links don't have a disabled state in HTML, only form elements. We can make a link element effectively disabled using CSS - making its text grey or lowering the opacity and setting pointer-events:none to prevent any click or hover events.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's just me being a purist but I feel that disabled links are a bad idea. We should be using the established patterns rather than trying to invent new ones to solve problems. If our default enabled links were blue and our disabled ones pale grey, how would a user know this? Unfamiliar with the concept of grey links they would probably assume that it was just a :visited link and still try to use it.\r\n\r\nWith links I feel it's better for them to be simply shown or hidden. If they are revealed when certain conditions are met then it may be useful to add an animation to draw attention to them as they appear.",

As I read it I thought to myself that I don't really know anyone with poor skills - everyone I know is pretty good at this kind of stuff. Later the same day I was proved wrong.\r\n\r\nI got a call from a friend asking for my help on going through a process online. The options provided seemed obvious to me, even over the phone. They described what they wanted to do and then the 2 options on screen. The first was an exact match for their intention; the second something completely different. It made me realise that it's often not so much a case of not understanding what to do as being afraid to commit to it and wanting that extra reassurance.\r\n\r\nSome people have a fear that once they've pressed a button that's it and there's no going back and they're scared that they may make the wrong choice. I've noticed that a lot of websites have \"call to action\" buttons with text like \"Sign up\" or \"Buy now\". For these users with the fear, this could be a red light - they will see that action as a commitment they may not want. Those of us who know, know that this is just to initiate a process rather than to commit to it. It might be prudent to be cautious with actions and reflect more faithfully what will actually happen.\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be any need for this fear. Anything that can be done can be undone, or changed later. Well, almost anything. I can think of a few instances where choosing a username is a permanent choice but it's usually made clear if something cannot be changed.\r\n\r\nTo use a not-particularly-thought-through analogy, navigating through any kind of process online is a bit like driving around a car park. Whichever route you take you can always loop back around and get back to where you were. Worst case scenario - you can always exit and enter again.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "I'm guessing most people know what A/B Testing is. It's publishing 2 variations and monitoring the responses. A typical example might be a web page with a sign up call to action. There would be 2 versions of the page and visitors would be directed to one or the other. After a certain number of page views the number of sign-ups would be counted for each version. Version A might have had 4% sign ups whereas version B might have had 7%. Typically, the best performing page is then either used or put up against another version for another iteration of improvements.\r\n\r\nA/A Testing is the control. Visitors are again directed to one of two pages only this time both versions are exactly the same. Let's call them A1 and A2. Suppose A1 comes in with 5% sign-ups but A2 comes in with only 1%. What does that tell us? It basically tells us not to read too much into the A/B Testing as the differing results were probably just random chance.\r\n\r\nWith A/A Testing, as you monitor more and more users the split should get closer to 50/50. It's a good way of discovering what is a suitably large sample size for your A/B Tests.\r\n\r\nThe other problem with A/B Testing is its format. It's often set up to work like a knockout, winner stays on tournament - A vs. B, B vs. C, C vs. D, etc. This is flawed. If B beats A, then C beats B, C is the winner. But what if A would beat C? It's quite possible. For it to work all variations need to put pushed out at once so we're now doing A/B/C/D Testing and this will require a larger sample size.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not convinced it's very scientific in most cases. I think it can work well if you're Amazon or Google and have the traffic to get meaningful results but most companies using A/B Testing probably fall way short and are more or less flipping a coin to make their UX decisions.\r\n\r\nA/A Testing is a great way of debunking small scale A/B Testing as it proves that random chance plays a significant part in the outcome.",

    "post_content": "I've read some sales and marketing articles about techniques for trying to elicit an emotional response from your audience. The broad idea is that if you can get your audience to bond with you or your idea on an emotional level then this is very strong. The heart is stronger than the head, if you like.\r\n\r\nI hadn't taken too much notice but after recent world events it strikes me now that maybe there's something in it. I'm thinking in particular about the \"Brexit\" referendum and Donald Trump's election campaign. In both cases the winning parties made very strong statements, probably much stronger than their actual beliefs or intentions. This strength of message created an emotional response in people, either one way or another - love or hate - there's no doubt it was divisive. Whilst this approach will undoubtedly lose some supporters the division it creates will harden the resolve of those who do follow. They start to feel like a minority being ridiculed by the opposition and it only makes their belief stronger.\r\n\r\nThis is also connected with the idea that all press is good press. Trump must have had far more press column inches than Clinton. Maybe as the negative press coverage gets whipped up into a frenzy people start to feel sorry for the \"victim\"?\r\n\r\nTo give a slightly lighter example, on TV shows like X Factor, most viewers generally pick their favourite in the early stages and then continue to support them throughout. I don't think there are many viewers who vote for a different contestant each week based on merit. If your favourite gets heavy criticism you're far more likely to vote. These kind of shows will always be won by the one who seems like a nicest person rather than the most talented.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is something in this trying to make an emotional connection early on?",

As a user you have to click it to see the other available options only to find that there are none. This is a clear example of developer convenience being put before user experience.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it seems obvious now I've highlighted it but if there's only one option then there isn't a choice to be made at all and we don't need a form input. The code should conditionally show the drop down list only when there is a selection to be made, more than one item.\r\n\r\nDepending on the UI design, we could even take this a step further. Maybe a drop down list isn't the best choice for selecting between 2 items? A radio button list is probably better as it enables the user to see all of the available options at a glance and make a selection with a single click/touch. We can test the number of options and if it's below 5 show the options in a radio button list. &lt;ol&gt; might be a better choice than &lt;ul&gt; for the list if the items are in a specific order, e.g. years.\r\n\r\nAnother example I see is displaying disabled form controls where the control is never enabled, e.g. a checkbox which is disabled because the user doesn't have permissions to change it. If it's not an option, don't show it. Disabling it is the lazy option, easy for the developer. Hiding it is much better but may involve a change to layout. The UX should always be put first.

    "post_content": "I've done this quick run-through of things I've learned in the last 12 months for a few years now. It's great to reassure myself that I'm still learning and every time it surprises me how much new stuff I've picked up in a short space of time.\r\n<h3>HTML Email</h3>\r\nFor a while I've known that you have to use tables and inline styles rather than CSS. Actually there's a lot more to it and you can use CSS and even media queries. You just have to be prepared for when they're not supported with nice fallbacks. There's an excellent course on <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com\" target=\"_blank\">CodeSchool</a> called <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/unmasking-html-emails\" target=\"_blank\">Unmasking HTML Emails</a>.\r\n<h3>SVG</h3>\r\nI put this one in last year too but I think it's fair as I've learned more this year. It's surprising how under-used this is considering how easy it is now to make web graphics. I recommend Chris Coyier's <a href=\"https://abookapart.com/products/practical-svg\" target=\"_blank\">Practical SVG</a> book.\r\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\r\nWe all know we should do more but ironically it's a bit \"out of sight, out of mind\". I've started to actually do something about it. As I build new screens or components I just run them through some basic checks. There's a great Chrome extension called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog\" target=\"_blank\">aXe</a>, which you run in the dev tools. It lists accessibility violations for your page and even quotes the WCAG docs to show you exactly where you're causing an issue. It then provides tips on how to resolve the issue, often just adding an aria attribute, title or alt text. I've also started checking colours to ensure they have adequate contrast for users with visual impairments but it also just makes it that little bit easier for all users. <a href=\"http://contrastchecker.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Contrast Checker</a> is a great tool for this and let's you build up your own palettes and export to PDF.\r\n<h3>Microformats</h3>\r\nThis is an odd one. I've stumbled across it and think it's a really neat idea but I'm not convinced anyone else is using it. Please let me know if you are. It's basically using a fixed pattern of markup (HTML and classes) to represent a common use case for greater consistency. The example I've used is marking up an address with lines for street address, town, county, postcode/ZIP, etc. the theory is that if we use a recognisable format then machines, like browsers, can pick them up and use them intelligently. So, if you add your addresses in this prescriptive format then a phone might offer the user the option of adding it to their contact list. Not sure it it'll be adopted but it takes a lot of the thinking and naming away. The official docs are at <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2\" target=\"_blank\">microformats2</a>. From the blog it does sound pretty active.\r\n<h3>Tab Triggers</h3>\r\nI'm not sure if this is the right name for them but basically being able to type shorthand code and hit the TAB key writes out proper HTML. For example, in Visual Studio or Codepen, the 2 main tools I use, you can type table&gt;tbody&gt;tr*5&gt;td*3 and hit TAB and you get all the HTML for a table with 5 rows and 3 columns. If you type img and hit TAB you get a self closed image tag with the src and alt attributes inserted. It saves loads of time. Probably the best discovery of the year. Is this the right name for them? Let me know if not.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMore in the next part...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

In 2017 I'm going to run (a minimum of) 500 miles.\r\n\r\nI generally do go out running quite regularly and even do the odd event but I tend to go through phases of not going out for 3 weeks then going out lots. I thought that if I set a total to aim for then I can see how I'm doing against where I should be if runs were evenly distributed - if I'm ahead of schedule or falling behind.\r\n\r\nSo, how does 500 miles break down? Well, 52 weeks a year, it's roughly 10 miles a week with a couple of weeks off for good behaviour. I could calculate it further but that's good enough for me to get the extra motivation I need.\r\n\r\nI'm using a free online database tool called Airtable to record my progress against my target. Here's the embed which will update with my progress as I record it.

    "post_content": "This is the second part of a three-part post about the new things that I picked up through the course of 2016.\r\n\r\nI (finally) took some big steps in CSS this year, picking up some of the things I'd been putting off for a while.\r\n<h3>Flexbox</h3>\r\nI'd heard a lot of good things about Flexbox but having to support older browsers I'd never really bothered with it. Finally, this year, with support for older IE getting dropped I decided to dive in. It's amazing. It can handle just about anything you would need for layouts. I'm sure there are now loads of great resources for learning it but the two I used were Wes Bos's <a href=\"https://flexbox.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Flexbox.io</a> videos and Chris Coyier's <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\" target=\"_blank\">A Complete Guide to Flexbox</a>.\r\n<h3>Sass</h3>\r\nThe really big one for me this year was learning <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sass</a>. I know I've come to this very late. I was never that keen on the idea of adding another layer of complexity for my own convenience rather than for any actual user benefit. I still don't think it's really needed, it's a just a nice convenience. That said, it does make writing CSS, particularly modular CSS a lot easier. Nesting, variables and mixins make it much easier to keep things consistent and manageable. CodeSchool's <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass\" target=\"_blank\">Assembling Sass</a> course was very good.\r\n<h3>Bootstrap</h3>\r\nI've used <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bootstrap</a> on and off for a while but only recently did a course in it. It turns out that there are loads of little utility classes built in to handle all sorts of variations of the basic components. It's well worth learning properly rather than just diving in and grabbing bits and pieces. Like with Sass I don't think you really need a CSS framework but it can certainly speed things along nicely once you know your way around. Our friends at CodeSchool came up trumps again, <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/blasting-off-with-bootstrap\" target=\"_blank\">Blasting Off with Bootstrap</a>.\r\n<h3>(Angular) Material</h3>\r\nI didn't go deep into this, just had a bit of a play. <a href=\"https://material.angularjs.org\" target=\"_blank\">Angular Material</a> is very nice and fairly easy to use but I came unstuck as I was trying to use parts of the framework within an existing page layout. It got messy pretty quickly. I think Material is a bit \"all or nothing\" - you use it fully or not at all.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nAnd now for something completely different...\r\n\r\nBeing a front-end guy I rarely (never) touch the database world. Writing a request to an API is about as close as I get but recently I've poked about with a couple of things.\r\n<h3>MongoDB</h3>\r\nI liked the name. I got curious. I've done some stuff with SQL many moons ago so I was interested to see how a database could work without it. If you're used to JavaScript objects and JSON it's actually really nice to use. You just push and pull objects, query by properties, that kind of thing. I didn't go deep into it but was very impressed. It's very much sticking with JavaScript thinking. I think it's got a bit of a bad reputation but I'm inclined to think that was some early teething trouble and mud sticking rather than a serious issue. Glass half full. I might be wrong.\r\n<h3>Airtable</h3>\r\nAnother play thing. <a href=\"https://airtable.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Airtable</a> lets you build databases and views, query, filter, sort, run formulae, rollups, lookups, etc. It also gives you forms, galleries where you can show your data in a card format, calendars and a whole lot more. It's free for the basics and is lovely to use mainly down to some very good UI design. It also has an API for sharing the data with applications.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMore in the next part...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "This is the third part of a three part blog post on the things I've learned over the last year. So far I've covered HTML, CSS and a rare (for me) bit of databasey stuff. And now the final part, the JavaScript...\r\n<h3>Node.js</h3>\r\nI haven't gone into this in depth but was curious about how JavaScript might look on the server. There are lots of in-built functions for working with files and requests but otherwise it really is just JavaScript - objects, functions, if statements, for loops, etc. I think it would take a bit of getting used to but having a JavaScript background it's probably much easier than learning something else like Ruby or PHP. I learned this from CodeSchool, <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js\" target=\"_blank\">Real-time Web with Node.js</a>.\r\n<h3>Modular Functions in JavaScript</h3>\r\nI really didn't know what to call this but I know what I mean by it so I'll try to explain. It's just a way of thinking about JavaScript functions so they're separated and easier to test. Each function performs a single job so rather than a function being a wrapper for lots of different jobs, e.g. a conditional test then some string manipulation then constructing an object to return. Each job is broken down into its own function so we end up with lots of tiny functions which call each other rather than long routines. The second part to this is not relying on any variables which sit outside of the function scope. So, not referring back to a variable in the global scope or in a parent function. If our function needs to refer to something it needs to be passed in explicitly as an argument. This just makes it completely self-contained so it can be picked up and dropped in a different context and still do its job without worrying about being affected by the scope.\r\n\r\nI started using this methodology after reading a blog post but, sadly, I can not longer remember the source. If anyone knows what this is called or who might have written a good article on it please let em know in the comments.\r\n<h3>ES2015</h3>\r\nAs I've managed to start dropping support for older browsers it has opened the doors on some new features in JavaScript, namely, ES6 or, as I think we're supposed to call it, ES2015. I did another CodeSchool course, <a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/courses/es2015-the-shape-of-javascript-to-come\" target=\"_blank\">ES2015: The Shape of JavaScript to Come</a>. In short it takes a bit of getting used to but ultimately means you can do more writing less, which has to be a good thing. Using tools like <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Babel</a> we can even use it in older browsers now - it cleverly converts it back to ES5 where needed.\r\n<h3>TypeScript</h3>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" target=\"_blank\">TypeScript</a> is like JavaScript but upgraded to be a strongly typed object oriented language. It then compiles down to JavaScript, a bit like Sass to CSS. Like CSS is valid Sass, JavaScript is valid TypeScript so you can convert your existing files without it being a major drama. You declare the type of any variable and if there's any error or uncertainty it won't compile. This means that you can never have any type errors in production, which is very nice. The number of times I've had to fix bugs around some function expecting an integer but getting a string. The other side to it is being able to use modules and classes - it's proper scoping and namespacing.\r\n\r\nAs we're working with Angular I actually did the Pluralsight course, Angular with TypeScript. With hindsight, I'd probably just do a TypeScript course so as not to blur the lines.\r\n<h3>Dragula</h3>\r\nThis is a library for using drag and drop functionality. I've always used <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/droppable/\" target=\"_blank\">jQuery UI</a> <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/draggable/\" target=\"_blank\">draggable</a>, <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/droppable/\" target=\"_blank\">droppable</a> or <a href=\"https://jqueryui.com/sortable/\" target=\"_blank\">sortable</a> previously but was keen to see what could be done without the jQuery dependency. <a href=\"https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/\" target=\"_blank\">Dragula</a> is actually very similar to use, selectors, options object, etc. but uses vanilla JavaScript. Getting into more complex uses the documentation and Stack Overflow answers started to dry up a bit. I guess that's one of the advantages of using the big libraries.\r\n<h3>Toastr</h3>\r\n<a href=\"https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/\" target=\"_blank\">Toastr</a> is another nice little utility library. This does pop-up or toaster notifications. It requires jQuery so may not be for everyone but has loads of options and stacks multiple notifications elegantly, which is not easy. This is probably one of the easiest things I've ever used.\r\n\r\nAnd that about wraps it up. Who knows what 2017 holds. At the moment I'm very curious about some new JavaScript frameworks - <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue.js</a> and <a href=\"https://svelte.technology/\" target=\"_blank\">Svelte</a>.",

    "post_content": "<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stack Overflow</a> is both brilliant and terrible. As a web developer it's one of those sites that you just have to use, like Can I Use, MDN or CSS Tricks. You can Google any coding issue and the question will pop up in the first few results, you click through, scroll down to the accepted answer or the one with all the upvotes and 8 times out of 10 problem solved. Brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere's another side to it. The accepted answer is selected by the user who asked the question (the OP), someone who isn't an expert in this area. The solution works, they mark it as the accepted answer and get on with their lives. Meanwhile, others are providing different, possibly better, answers. These better answers may get some upvotes but a lot of visitors are just looking for a quick fix and won't read every answer and so won't upvote alternatives in any great numbers. So, the best answer can easily be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThere's also a bandwagon or snowball effect. As more people come past and use the \"top\" answer it gets more love, pushing other answers further into obscurity.\r\n\r\nThen, there's another side to it. Time. On the web, things change. What was a great answer 5 years ago might be not be the best way of doing things today. So, you arrive at the question, see the accepted answer and answers with loads of votes and assume they must be right. Maybe not. It only means that they were the most popular answers at some point in time. There could be a much better answer lurking at the bottom with no votes. They need to consider recency as a factor in ranking answers like Google do. Nobody cares about an answer on browsers from 6 years ago.\r\n\r\nSurely you can just ask the question again, a few years later? Oh no! \"Duplicate question, duplicate question!\" the moderators squeal and it gets binned. It's happened to me loads of times. \"Possible duplicate of question 1917543\" they sneer, pointing.\r\n\r\nThis, for me is the terrible side. It's not the flawed logic of the question and answer format, it's the snarky, show-off, know-it-alls who comment on each other's answers. Each of them is desperate to show off his or her (his, let's be honest) own knowledge and score points. Worthless, meaningless points.\r\n\r\nIt takes a lot of confidence to submit an answer, raising your head above the parapet, ready to be shot down. It makes me very reluctant to help my fellow developers, which I feel is a sad thing.\r\n\r\nRant over. I still use it daily so it must be doing something right. :)",

The Award is assessed by an online test and a 4,000 word eMarketing report.\n\nEMarketing encompasses not only marketing through the web but all forms of electronic marketing so looks at things like email, interactive digital TV, mobile phones, CD-ROMs, etc. The web side looks at not only how to develop a successful website but all the other tools and tricks available to anyone looking to promote their business. It was a real eye opener for me. I now feel that I properly understand the meaning of Web 2.0 - blogging, RSS, social networking. Things have really moved on in the last few years and static brochure type websites are quickly being left behind by the new web 2.0 interactive sites which actively involve the customers in the whole web experience.\n\nThe real beauty of online marketing compared to conventional forms of offline marketing is that everything is quantifiable. Every time anyone sees an advert it is logged. If they click a link it is logged. This makes it very easy to way up the return on your investment and keep your marketing budget going on the right things.\n\nAs well as all the marketing hints and tips the course also looks at how eMarketing fits in with the rest of your business - customer service, data management, development of new products and services.\n\nAll being well I hope to gain this professional qualification by the end of 2008.",

On it <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> openly admits \"We've used components from <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>'s <a href=\"http://webkit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WebKit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a>\". So, maybe not an entirely fresh take then?\r\n\r\nSo, on going in, what are my first impressions? Well, first thought, it looks pretty much the same as <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx\" target=\"_blank\"><abbr title=\"Internet Explorer\">IE</abbr></a> and <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a>. The browsing tabs have been shifted above the address bar, which, as far as I can see, is just a change for change's sake rather than serving any useful purpose - why make people have to get used to something new when the browers they are used to work just fine? Other than that, without delving too deep, I'm struggling to find anything radically different.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, it doesn't have loads of toolbars, keeping a nice clean, simple appearance - one of the great strengths of <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google's search engine</a>. After using it for a while, I noticed that it remembers the sites you visit and uses this data intelligently to make it quicker to revisit them. It's fast too, noticeably quicker than <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products\" target=\"_blank\">IE</a>.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, it doesn't seem to handle RSS feeds and feed reading as well as <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products\" target=\"_blank\">IE</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> (with RSS add-ons) but I'm sure this will come.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> has been the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/\" target=\"_self\">web professional</a>'s choice for years now and with good reason. So, will <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a> offer us anything new that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> can't? As I see it, the reason for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a>'s success hasn't been about speed or security but freedom. It's great strength is that it's so easy to customise and ease of using <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">add-ons</a> make it much more than a tool for reading web content. I'm assuming that, being an open source project, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a> will follow suit.\r\n\r\nIt seems a shame to me that all of the excellent <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/\" target=\"_self\">developers</a> out there who have been building add-ons for <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> will now be split between <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a>.\r\n\r\nI don't think that <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> will better <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a> but they will be able to match it and with their finances and history of buying up big web companies (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedburner.com\" target=\"_blank\">FeedBurner</a>) I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we saw Google Firefox before too long.\r\n\r\nSee what you think - <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Google Chrome</a>",

Well, to do it at a basic level is very simple. Choose a time period to analyse - the last 12 months, last 3 months, last 30 days, etc. Now, in this period see how much profit you made and how many visitors your website got. If you're using a web stats package, unique visitors is the figure to use here. Simply divide the number of unique visitors by the profit and this will give you a mean profit per visitor. You can use this as a basis for spending on <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_blank\">gaining more visitors</a>.\n\nWhilst more visitors means more profit you shouldn't just look at <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">boosting traffic</a> but try to actively increase the value of each online visitor. If a visitor becomes more likely to buy from you they become more valuable and investing money in <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">attracting more visitors</a> then gives you <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">better value for money</a>. So, as well as your traffic you also need to try to improve your conversion rate. The conversion rate is simply the proportion of visitors who buy. There are lots of things you can do to boost your conversion rates but that's for another day...",

    "post_content": "There's so much written about links, linking strategies, link exchanges and so much conflicting advice out there. How do you know who or what to believe?\r\n\r\nWell, it's actually quite simple. Don't listen to anyone, not even me. When it comes to links and what you should do let's see what <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> has to say. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> has a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\" target=\"_blank\">Webmasters</a> section of their site which gives clear guidelines of what you should and shouldn't do. Read it. Do it.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of links this page is a good place to start: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=66356\" target=\"_blank\">Creating a Google-friendly site: Best practices &gt; Link schemes</a>.\r\n\r\nGoogle's advice: \"some webmasters engage in link exchange schemes and build partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking, disregarding the quality of the links, the sources, and the long-term impact it will have on their sites. This is in violation of Google's webmaster guidelines and can negatively impact your site's ranking in search results.\"\r\n\r\nIn summary, links are important but it's about quality not just quantity.\r\n\r\nGetting links is difficult. If people like your site's content they will link to it. The more people link to it, the more people see it and so on in a snowball effect. But... how do you get people to like your content when nobody is viewing it because you don't have enough incoming links - it's a vicious circle. How do you get your little snowball started down the hill?\r\n\r\nGive it a little push. Here are 3 great ways to get going:\r\n\r\n1. Add your site to directories, not any directory going but directories where the theme or content is relevant to your site. Try a Google search for your theme or industry plus the word \"directory\" or \"listing\" and see if you can add your site. You could also try \"add site\" or \"submit your site\" to see where you can get a free link. Before going too mad creating directory links remember it's about quality as well as quantity - it's all quite logical - a link from a site where you're allowed to add your own links isn't going to be worth as much as a link that someone else has chosen to add.\r\n\r\n2. Get involved in forums or online communities. Find sites relevant to your site where you are allowed to contribute and join in. Don't be obvious and steam in advertising your site but get involved in discussions, try to help people out and, soon enough, if they're interested in what you've got to say they'll look at your site.\r\n\r\n3. Blog. Write articles or posts, just like this one, and post it on your own site or submit it to a blogging or article site. Be sure to include an interesting headline and some links back to your site. Submit this to the right blog search engines (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.technorati.com\" target=\"_blank\">Technorati</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digg.com\" target=\"_blank\">Digg</a>) and it will be read and passed around gaining you not only links but visitors in the process.

I'll explain what it is and some of the benefits.\n\nA <abbr title=\"Content Management System\">CMS</abbr> is a system which sits behind a website and allows you to edit a website easily. It's called a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_blank\">content management system</a> because it specifically allows changes to the content of the website - the text, images and links on pages - but not the layout or <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_blank\">design</a>, which stays fixed.\n\nThe usual method of changing web content is by logging in and gaining access to an admin or control panel. This gives options of creating, editing or deleting pages as well as setting up page order and hierarchy (which pages are sub-options of others).\n\nWhen it comes to editing pages this is normally done through a visual or <abbr title=\"What You See Is What You Get\">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor, which is short for \"What You See Is What You Get\" so no knowledge of HTML or web page coding is required. It's very easy to use, as easy as using Microsoft Word, probably easier. You write your page's content in a large text area and have buttons to help with formatting - Bold, Italics, Underline, bullets, numbering, text alignment, indent, etc. You may be able to select from a limited range of fonts though this is usually controlled by the design template to ensure a consistent look and feel throughout the site. The best part is, you don't even have to use the <abbr title=\"What You See Is What You Get\">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor - you can simply paste your content from another application, like Word.\n\nAs well as working with text you can insert various media - images, video clips, audio files, Flash.\n\nSo, what are the benefits? Well, the main benefit is that anyone can use it which means that your site can be managed by anyone. In a medium or large company that means anyone in a team, not just the IT person or contracted <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web design company</a>. For a small private site it gives you full freedom to control your content and changes happen instantly - no more waiting for the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web designer</a> to make your changes.\n\nIf you're still using a static website and relying on someone else to update it, it's time to take control and manage your own content.",

Content is the text and images that visitors read and look at; style is how these are arranged, laid out and presented.The style side is where the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web designer</a> comes in. This is his/her main area of expertise and he/she will have the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">design skills</a> to present your content in a way which communicates your message clearly and professionally.\n\nThe content is the site owner's responsibility. In <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">website marketing</a> content is king. The main reason a visitor will come back to your site is because he/she found what they were looking for. The look and feel are very much secondary to this.\n\nCreating your content can appear a little daunting if you've never thought about it before, even for a small site, but it's really quite simple if you approach it in the right way. You may not have designed a site before but you have used plenty of sites. The trick, as with any marketing, is to put yourself in the visitor's shoes. You need to consider:\n<ul>\n\t<li>When they come to your site, what are their objectives - what might they want to go away with?</li>\n\t<li>What information will they expect to see?</li>\n\t<li>What other information might be helpful to them?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you can consider these things you will satisfy your website's visitors. The next step is to check out the online competition.\n<ul>\n\t<li>What do similar sites (your competitors) offer?</li>\n\t<li>Can you offer anything that they don't?</li>\n\t<li>Can you make your site more useable than theirs?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you can give your website visitors what they want better than your competitors do you have a recipe for a successful site. Pair that with professional styling and your site will be a great success.",

At a basic level it's about making everything consistent and not leaving any holes.\n\n<strong>Consistent Information</strong>\n\nMake sure that whatever information you have on your website is consistent with any offline information. Anything like details of a product or service should really be a word for word match as any anomalies could create confusion. Customers who are not sure what they're getting won't buy. Don't kid yourself that they'll phone and check; they'll find the next website.\n\n<strong>Customer Contact</strong>\n\nUnlike a physical business your website is accessible 24 hours a day. Therefore, if you provide a phone number on your site you should make it clear when people can use it. If it just rings and rings they may not call back. You should either put clear calling hours against it, offer an answering service or offer a callback facility. This last option has advantages for both you and your potential customer - the customer doesn't pay for the call and you don't miss out on capturing the customer's interest. Who knows if they'd still feel like calling you at 9.00am the next morning?\n\nAs well as phone contact you need to deal with form submisisons or emails in an appropriate way. Autoresponders are good. When the visitor sends you an email or submits a form they get an email just confirming that it has been received and will be dealth with. Set a realistic timescale for this, or better, set a timescale and then respond much quicker - exceed the customer's expectations.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">Integrated Web Design</a></strong>\n\nA <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">good web developer</a> will not <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">design your website</a> as a stand alone unit but will look at how it integrates with your business needs.",

Now could be the right time to make the leap.\n\nIf you produce a brochure it's probably costing you thousands. You've then got all the distribution costs - covering letters, envelopes, postage. With a website you've got an initial cost (almost certainly lower than brochure print costs), some annual maintenance costs (hosting, backups) and then <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">internet marketing</a> costs (<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">promoting your website</a> to get your business found). The big cost difference online is that when you come to the next cycle you don't have this initial outlay again as you would with a brochure. There's a huge saving to be made.\n\nMoving your marketing publications from offline to online won't just save you thousands, it has other benefits. With a traditional brochure the only way of measuring its effectiveness is seeing which of its recipients go on to enquire and then which buy. In reality most companies don't even track this and don't really know whether or not their brochure works but carry on with it blindly more out of habit than anything. With a website and <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">online marketing tools</a> everything is tracked, logged and measurable. Consider the advantages of knowing all this:\n<ul>\n\t<li>You will know how many people visit your website. With a brochure how many are read and how many go straight in the bin? You've no idea.</li>\n\t<li>You will know which products people are looking at. Again, with a brochure you're in the dark.</li>\n\t<li>You will know how people found your site - from search engines, from other sites or by typing in your web address (from offline promotion).</li>\n\t<li>With online advertising you will know exactly how many people have viewed your ad and how many have clicked it. Compare this with an ad in a newspaper or magazine - there's no easy way of knowing how effective it is.</li>\n</ul>\nMoving your marketing from offline to online will not only save you money but will provide you with exact data which can be used to inform your marketing decisions. This means <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">better marketing</a> and less money wasted on ineffective marketing.",

On the surface they may both look the same but with <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">great design</a> come all the finishing touches, all those little details which make your site look that little bit more professional and, more importantly, perform better.\n\nIf you've got a website already has your designer provided all of these?\n\n<strong>Favicon\n</strong>Favicon is short for \"Favorites\" icon and is the little graphic which is displayed when your site is bookmarked. It appears in your list of \"Favorites\" or Bookmarks, on your desktop if someone places a shortcut to a website there and in the address bar and on the tab in your web browser.\n\n<strong>Email\n</strong>When a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> is setting up your website it's reasonable to expect that they set up your email using the same domain at the same time. This can be done in several ways - forward all mail to an existing account, set up a new mailbox or set up a catch all account whereby anything sent to your domain will be delivered to you.\n\n<strong>Email Filters\n</strong>As well as email you should also expect anti-virus and anti-spam filters to be applied.\n\n<strong>Email Autoresponders\n</strong>Your email can be configured to automatically respond to incoming mail. This is useful to reassure your website visitors that the email they sent or form they submitted has been received. It can also provide useful information like alternative contact details, when they can expect a response or point them towards an area of your website, e.g. FAQ, or make them aware of your latest promotion.\n\n<strong>Sitemap\n</strong>If your site is larger than 7 pages it's good practice to include a sitemap, an easy place for your visitors to go and see the contents of your website at a glance. This is also very good for search engine ranking as it reinforces your site structure and offers more internal links to be crawled.\n\n<strong>XML Sitemap\n</strong>A <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/docs/en/protocol.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google XML Sitemap</a> is a small XML data file which lists the pages in your site. It's in a specific format which Google recognises and it gives you greater recognition by the major search engines. The same format is now also used by Yahoo! and Live. By not creating this and submitting it to Google you risk a great delay in your site being indexed and people finding it.\n\n<strong>Robots.txt\n</strong>This is a small text file which tells search engine robots which parts of your site they can access and index. It is also used to signpost the XML sitemap file. Without this your sitemap might not be found.\n\n<strong>Search Engine and Directory Submission\n</strong>Once your website is finished the next step is getting it found. Some <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web designers</a> feel that this is where their job ends and someone's else's begins. Others will take this on and actively try to make the website work for their client. A good practice when launching a new site is to submit it to the search engines so that they crawl and index it. It's also advisable to submit your site to as many directory sites as possible. There are thousands out there which accept listings free of charge and this helps to build up incoming links to your site which may or may not help with search engine ranking but will certainly give human web users the opportunity to follow links in to your site.\n\n<strong>Marketing Advice\n</strong>Rather than just leaving you to it a great web designer will pass on useful information and advice on how to grow your site and make it as successful as possible. It is amazing how many do the design job and walk away when it is in their interest to create sites which work for their clients.\n\nWhen buying <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web development services</a> it's important to check exactly what you're getting for your money. When you have a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">website designed by Chris Smith</a> all of these finishing touches come as standard.",

There's far more competition now than there was a few years ago. If you do a Google search for \"<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">cheap web design</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">budget web design</a>\" or \"<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">affordable web design</a>\" then there are a lot of web pages out there with those page titles.\n\nWhat I find curious is that the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">web design</a> product or service being offered in this market and the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=37\" target=\"_self\">pricing</a> structures don't seem to have moved on since 2004.\n\nThe vast majority of companies competing in this market still seem to be offering very basic static brochure sites. The process here is 1) the client sends text and images to the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=2\" target=\"_self\">web designer</a>, 2) the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=2\" target=\"_self\">designer</a> puts them in HTML pages, 3) repeat stages 1 and 2. This means that if the client needs to make a change to the website's information - new products, price changes, news updates, etc. - he or she needs to go through the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">designer</a> who probably charges a modest (if you're lucky) fee for the work.\n\nMuch stranger than the product on offer though is the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=37\" target=\"_self\">pricing structure</a>. The majority of these seem to be sold as packages (design, hosting, email) based on the number of pages in the site. This makes no sense to me at all. It's usual for all pages within a website to have a similar look and feel. They generally all use a common template which includes the header, footer and navigation menus along with any styles (fonts, colours, etc.) used throughout the site. Therefore, most of the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web designer</a>'s work goes into creating this template. Once this is designed it makes little difference whether a website has 1 page or 100. It's very curious then that so many of these companies offering \"<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">cheap web design</a>\" will offer, for example, a 4 page site for £150 but a 6 page site will set you back £350. That's a £200 jump in price for what I'd estimate to be half an hour's work. <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">Cheap web design</a> doesn't have to mean a small website and a large website doesn't have to cost the earth.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">Chris Smith Web Development</a> offers something different. I offer not static web pages but an installation of a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?p=68\" target=\"_self\">content management system</a>. This means that rather than having to come back to me to make changes to your pages you can simply log in and do it yourself, whenever and wherever you want to. No delays and no additional fees. The <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=37\" target=\"_self\">pricing</a> is based on the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">template design</a> so there's no limit on how many pages you can have. All you have to do is log in, select the Write Page option, write your content, click on Publish and it's there for the world to see, as many times as you like. You can go back and edit or delete pages, reorder them, change their titles whenever you want to.\n\nSince 2004 I <em>have</em> moved on and have developed a better product. Static sites, charged for by the page, are no match for the flexibility and freedom offered by a content management system.",

Last night I got my results in the post...\n\nI'm proud to say that I achieved <strong>grade A distinctions</strong> in both my online examination and 4,000 word eMarketing report.\n\nThe course covers all aspects of <strong>electronic marketing</strong>.  I studied with <a title=\"Marketing Tom\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.marketingtom.com\" target=\"_blank\">Marketing Tom Media</a>, a CIM approved centre based near Cardiff, and would certainly recommend both course and <a href=\"http://www.marketingtom.com\" target=\"_blank\">training provider</a> to anyone interested in growing their business online.\n\nPerhaps what is most satisfying is that the report which I wrote is not simply being filed away as an academic exercise but is actually being used as a <strong>strategy</strong> for a major organisation's <strong>electronic marketing activities</strong>.\n\nIn addition to this I have taken on board many of the <strong>tactics</strong> and <strong>resources</strong> covered by the course and have <strong>successfully grown</strong> a number of websites. Since attending the course I have rebuilt this website and started using lots of online resources, my favourite being FeedBurner. My site now gets 3 to 4 times the <strong>traffic </strong>it had previously, ranks much higher in <strong>Google</strong> search listings and has brought in <strong>more enquiries</strong>, which is the real measure of its success.",

We all know how <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> works - you type in your search term, hit the \"search button\", <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> beavers away in the background trying to match what you typed with the most likely matches and you're presented with a list of results, all within a split second.\n\nIf you are logged into <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> when you do the same search things are now slightly different. Once the results come back you are given further options. You can \"promote\" a site by clicking on the little up arrow next to it. This is your way of saying that this is the site you wanted and it will push it to the top of the list for next time you do that search. You also have the option of clicking \"remove\", the cross. This means that the result is not relevant to you and won't be shown next time around. Finally, you can \"comment\" by clicking on the speech bubble. This allows you to make notes as you go.\n\nIt doesn't stop there though. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> doesn't just remember your feedback on searches you have done but uses this information to predict your areas of interest. For example, if I do a search for \"ajax\" it will, in all probability, return results on Ajax the <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web programming technology</a>. For someone else with no interest in <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp\" target=\"_self\">web development</a> but an interest in football it may return results on the Dutch football team.\n\nThe wider effect of this new personalised search is that as people start making use of it then what one person sees when they perform a search may not be what another person sees. In fact, after prolonged use it almost definitely won't be. This means that the <a href=\"http://www.seoexpert.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">SEO</a> companies who claim that they will get you top rankings on <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> will no longer be able to measure how well your site is faring. They will be forced to revert to using numbers of visitors to a website as a measure of success instead, which, as any <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">marketing </a>person will tell you, is the only real measure anyway.",

After I'd completed my ordering he asked me if he could have a go. To put this in context he's at the stage where he can recognise brands (e.g. Tesco, M&amp;S, etc.), his own name and a few letters but can't actually read other words.\n\nI found it fascinating to observe how he managed to use the site easily despite not being able to read.\n\n<img class=\"alignright\" style=\"float: right;border: 0;margin: 20px\" src=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/addtobasket.gif\" alt=\"Add to Shopping Basket\" width=\"166\" height=\"27\" />He clicked the logo taking him back to the home page. On there he saw a product image he liked (Star Wars video game), clicked it. On this page he clicked a play icon to watch a video preview of the game. When that ended he clicked the yellow button with a shopping basket icon to buy it. He then looked further down the screen where Amazon displays other related products - items other customers bought or viewed - and found some Star Wars toys. By following this process of clicking on related products and adding them to the basket he soon had over £300 of toys and video games in the basket. He even seemed to understand the product star rating system.\n\nThis speaks volumes about how good the design of this site is.\n\nIt can be navigated without any need for reading text. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>'s use of images and dynamically generating related images is superb. The human brain processes and recognises images and icons much faster than it can read text.\n\nIt's obvious how to buy something even to someone with almost no previous internet experience. A clear button which stands out from the rest of the page bearing a shopping basket icon leaves no doubt about how you proceed to buy the product.\n\nOne final tip - if you've got young children make sure you don't leave yourself logged in to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> or Father Christmas might be back sooner than you'd expect.",

Even though we know this taking the plunge and stopping print media suddenly is scary.\n\nIt doesn't have to be so sudden and drastic. It is possible to use a more gentle phased approach.\n\n<strong>Stage 1 - Getting the web right</strong>\n\nIf this is going to work the website has to have the most up to date information, and if not exactly consitent with printed information, the web needs to be the most accurate source of information.\n\n<strong>Stage 2 - Produce a Digital Edition</strong>\n\nWhen your publication is complete create what is called a digital edition or an electronic version of it which can be downloaded or emailed to people. The most common format for this is PDF but you can use anything which can be easily distributed electronically.\n\nWhilst a PDF download might not have quite the same feel as holding a high quality brochure in your hands there are advantages. Firstly, the customer gets it right away, whilst they're still interested. By the time a brochure arrives in the post the next day they may have gone off the idea or found a competitor's information online. The download also means that they can share it with friends or colleagues easily and at zero cost.\n\nRather than launching both print and electronic media simultaneously it might be better to release the electronic version in advance. By doing this anyone waiting for the publication will have their information earlier and there's a good chance they may not feel the need for a print version.\n\nWhen it comes to the next edition of the publication it is worth considering the electronic means of distribution when it is designed. For example, if printed by the user, does it look good in black and white, does it fit onto A4?\n\n<strong>Stage 3 - Monitor publication requests</strong>\n\nOnce you have both hard copy and electronic versions out there it's essential to monitor how many people are accessing the 2 types of media. You need to keep a note of how many hard copies are requested and compare this against numbers of downloads. Over time you should notice a natural increase in the downloads and this will, in turn, create a drop in the requests for print.\n\n<strong>Stage 4 - Use incentives</strong>\n\nWhen trying to get numbers using the electronic media up and print down you can give people a nudge in the right direction by offering reduced prices online. Even those who don't use the internet might show an interest if they hear they can get something 10% cheaper.\n\n<strong>Stage 5 - Reduce print runs</strong>\n\nRather than stop the publication altogether it may be preferable to reduce quantities slowly over time based on the demand you have been monitoring until you reach the point where the publication no longer offers a return on your investment.",

After babysitting it through the initial tedium of installing, connecting, updating, registering - lots of watching progress bars and restarting the machine every few minutes, I realised that I have my own strong ideas about which software I'm going to use for various tasks.\n\n<a href=\"http://free.avg.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"float: right;border: 0;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px\" src=\"http://free.avg.com/stc/tpl/crp/img/frt/avg_logo_en.gif\" alt=\"AVG Free\" width=\"240\" height=\"67\" /></a><strong>Security</strong>\nTop of the priority list is security and getting some good anti-virus, anti-spyware software in place. I uninstalled the <a href=\"http://www.mcafee.com/\" target=\"_blank\">McAfee</a> 30 day trial. I'm sure it's excellent but why pay a subscription fee when there are free alternatives. I downloaded and installed <a href=\"http://free.avg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AVG Free</a> Version, which is free for home use. It performs scans and updates itself automatically keeping your PC safe.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"border: 0pt none;margin: 20px;float: right\" src=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/img/image-library/firefox-wordmark-horizontal_small.png\" alt=\"Mozilla Firefox\" width=\"206\" height=\"96\" /></a><strong>Web Browsing</strong>\nWindows Vista comes with <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> (IE) installed but personally I find that <a href=\"http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla Firefox</a> offers a much better web browsing experience. It's noticeably faster and the add-ons available mean that you can really customise it for your own needs. My personal favourites are <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865\" target=\"_blank\">Adblock Plus</a>, which collapses known ads in web pages and, of course, <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60\" target=\"_blank\">Web Developer</a>, which provides all sorts of options and extra information about the web page you are browsing.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.openoffice.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" style=\"border: 0;float: right;margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px;margin-top: 20px;margin-bottom: 20px\" src=\"http://why.openoffice.org/images/why_home.gif\" alt=\"OpenOffice.org\" width=\"150\" height=\"105\" /></a><strong>Office - Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Presentations\n</strong>I boldly decided to ignore the 30 day free trials of <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office</a> (<a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/word\" target=\"_blank\">Word</a>, <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/excel\" target=\"_blank\">Excel</a>, <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/powerpoint\" target=\"_blank\">PowerPoint</a>) and instead downloaded and installed <a href=\"http://www.openoffice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenOffice</a>. It's open source which means the code behind the software is freely available for software developers to tinker with and suggest improvements. <a href=\"http://www.openoffice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenOffice</a> is a suite of applications made up of Writer (word processing), Calc (spreadsheets), Impress (presentations/slideshows), Draw (graphics) and Base (databases). It's fully compatible with <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office</a> so you will always be able to open and edit anything you receive.\n\n<strong>Web Development</strong>\nFrom my software choices so far it may sound like I'm anti-<a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> but I'm really not. I'm just a big fan of open source software and the open collaboration. For my web development work I do love <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/vstudio/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>. There's a lighter version of it called <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/express/vwd/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Web Developer</a> which is free to download and use. This makes it easy, well, easier, to create dynamic database driven web applications.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"float: left;border: 0;margin: 20px\" src=\"http://www.opensource.org/files/garland_logo.png\" alt=\"Open Source\" width=\"118\" height=\"100\" /></a>In summary, there is a lot of free and open source software available and it's worth looking at your options rather than just going with the big names. Like me you might actually prefer some of the free software over the licensed and for the home user it could save you quite a bit of cash.",

For many users it has made personal emails a thing of the past. How can this be turned into an opportunity for businesses?\n\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> is about people, real individuals. If you want to promote a company's goods or services on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> you can't just set up a business account - you have to do so from an individual's perspective. So, what can you do?\n\n<strong>Create a Profile</strong>\n\nOn your profile write about the company / products / services you want to promote. At first you may think that's it's only friends and family who will be reading it but open it up to Friends of Friends and that's a huge network of people potentially taking a look at your profile. This kind of personal endorsement of a company/product/service is very powerful and people will sit up and take much more notice of this than an ad.\n\n<strong>Create Groups, Events and Pages</strong>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> allows you to create a group for anything you wish. This allows discussion and sharing of media around the group's theme. On joining a group all user's friends are notified via the main feed so the potential to grow very quickly is huge. Once a group has members there are options for the group admin to contact all members so it's a quick and easy mailing list which manages itself. Events are similar to groups but for a limited timespan. Event invitations are highly effective as they ask for a response. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php\" target=\"_blank\">Pages</a> are again similar to groups but allow more in the way of content. Both events and pages have more prominence within individuals' profiles so greater exposure than groups.\n\n<strong>Get into the News Feed</strong>\n\nThis displays a summary of actions performed by a user's friends. The more you can feature your content in this feed, the more attention you will get and drive more traffic to your group, event or page.\n\n<strong>Import your Existing Content</strong>\n\nIf you have a website using an RSS Feed then <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> allows you to import this into your profile or page, writing content to the news feed with each update. Here's my own <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?src=fftb#/pages/Chris-Smith-Web-Development/6761319987\" target=\"_blank\">web development Facebook Page</a> which imports the content from my <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?feed=rss2\" target=\"_blank\">web development RSS feed</a>.<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?src=fftb#/pages/Chris-Smith-Web-Development/6761319987\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n\n<strong>And finally, a couple of don'ts...</strong>\n\nDon't try to stay anonymous and set up a fake account. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> is about individuals and transparency. If you set up a fake account it's only a matter of time before it's deleted.\n\nDon't try to contact lots of individuals using Messages. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> is very hot on spotting spam and if you send the same message to lots of individuals you will quickly get blocked from sending any.",

The concept of <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?p=27\" target=\"_self\">Web 2.0</a> seems to have brought with it a whole new vocabulary, some new words and some new meanings for existing words. I’ve listed a few here. If you can think of any more I’ve missed please feel free to comment and add to it.\n\n<strong>Application</strong>\nAn application is a program which runs on a social network. Applications can easily be shared and published.\n\n<strong>Avatar</strong>\nA picture or graphic used online to represent a person’s identity. This could be a photo, a cartoon or often just an amusing graphic.\n\n<strong>Blog</strong>\nBlog is short for weblog. A blog is like an online diary. It’s a series of articles or posts, with the date marked, generally updated quite regularly. These articles can be categorised, searched, tagged and consumed as RSS feeds.\n\n<strong>Blogspace</strong>\nA network of blogs and all their interconnections.\n\n<strong>Blogosphere</strong>\nSee blogspace.\n\n<strong>Comment</strong>\nIt’s common now for articles or blogs to allow their readers to interact with the content by posting a comment. These are usually found directly below the article or post. Some sites require you to create an account to comment, others simply that you provide your email address. Similarly, some comments have to be approved before they will appear, others don't.\n\n<strong>Consume</strong>\nThis is often used with feeds. Feeds can be consumed. This means that the feed content is reused and reposted elsewhere on the web.\n\n<strong>Fan</strong>\nBecoming a fan of another user or a page means you receive notifications of their activity.\n\n<strong>Feed</strong>\nA feed, also called a newsfeed or RSS feed, is a small portable file which shares a summary list of a website’s content. For example, a news site might make its headlines available for sharing. Feeds are often denoted by an orange button with white markings like this: <img style=\"border: 0\" src=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/rss.gif\" alt=\"RSS Feed\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" />\n\n<strong>Feed Reader</strong>\nA feed reader is a piece of software which consumes a feed, interprets the data contained in the feed and makes it available to read in a user friendly form.\n\n<strong>Friend</strong>\nA friend is somebody with whom you have a network connection on a social media site. Unlike the traditional sense of the word a friend in Web 2.0 can be someone you’ve never met and never intend to.\n\n<strong>Like</strong>\nYou can show that you like content on social media sites by clicking a like link. Some sites use a thumbs up icon to represent the same idea.\n\n<strong>Mashup </strong>(sometimes written \"mash-up\" or \"mash up\")\nA mashup is the combining of content from different sources to create a new entity.\n\n<strong>Newsfeed</strong>\nSee feed.\n\n<strong>Ping</strong>\nA notification from a website, usually about updated content.\n\n<strong>Pingback</strong>\nA pingback is a link back to a site that allows an author to see who is linking to his/her document.\n\n<strong>Podcast </strong>(sometimes written \"pod cast\")\nContent designed to be played back on personal media players, typically mp3 or video files.\n\n<strong>Profile</strong>\nA page about a person or organisation featuring information, photos, video and applications.\n\n<strong>Report</strong>\nWherever users are allowed to publish content there is potential for it to be abused. Many sites now offer an option to report inappropriate or abusive content.\n\n<strong>Re-tweet </strong>(sometimes written \"retweet\")\nTo re-tweet is to reply to a post on social media site <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.\n\n<strong>RSS Feed</strong>\nSee feed.\n\n<strong>Sidebar</strong>\nA sidebar is a vertical running menu in a blog or web page. These often control the site’s navigation as well as other widgets.\n\n<strong>Sping</strong>\nA sping is a ping or notification from a fake blog or splog.\n\n<strong>Splog</strong>\nA splog is a fake blog, derived from “spam” and “blog”. A splog will use content from another site and have no original content of its own. They exist to drive traffic to other sites or to make money from advertising.\n\n<strong>Status</strong>\nThe status is a one line post on what a user is doing. It’s an easy way of keeping other users up to date with what you are doing, thinking or feeling. Other users are free to comment on your status.\n\n<strong>Tag</strong>\nTagging a document means labelling it or assigning keywords to it. By tagging an article it makes it categorises it by your chosen keyword or tag making it easier to find.\n\n<strong>Trackback</strong>\nA trackback is a link that lets an author know who is linking to their article. It’s really just a reference which the author can see.\n\n<strong>Tweet</strong>\nTweeting simply means posting content on the social networking site <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>.\n\n<strong>Unlike</strong>\nWhere there are options to say that you like something, there is also the option to “unlike” something.

If you're looking to get a website developed I'd suggest you have a quick read of this: <a href=\"http://www.marketingtom.com/2009/02/beware-web-developers-who-know-nada.html\" target=\"_blank\">Beware Web Developers Who Know Nada!</a>\n\nAs a <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> myself I find it incredibly frustrating that I'm constantly losing <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web development</a> work to graphic designers who know nothing about marketing on the web. Does your business really need a piece of online art or does it actually want to see some return? As I see it there are only two things that matter - 1) are people finding the site and 2) is it giving them what they came for?\n\nMy other bugbear is that <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">web development</a> is as its name suggests \"developmental\". It's not a one off bit of work - build it, take the money, next. To be really successful, a website needs to evolve to meet the needs of its users so requires an ongoing cycle of analysis, review and redevelopment. This doesn't have to mean lots of expense or contracts. It just means stopping every once in a while and thinking about what is working, what isn't working, how many enquiries are you getting, is the number going up or down?\n\nIf you're serious about making money on the web, you need to be prepared to put a lot of work in yourself, not simply farm it out, and work closely with a  <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/wp-admin/making money on the web\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> who understands what your business needs from your site.",

You need to get it in front of your potential customers. Online is no different.\n\nToo many people out there still seem to think that <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">having a website built</a> is the job done. Get a website and then sit back and wait for people to visit it. Wrong. The offline equivalent is having your brochures printed and then leaving them in their boxes. Just <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">building a website</a> is not enough.\n\nSo, what can you do to distribute it and get it in front of your online customers? Here are some simple steps that should help.\n\nFirstly, you need to change the way you view the website compared with a more traditional printed brochure. The website is not equalivalent to a brochure. Your website in isolation is not worth anything. No, really. It's completely worthless. Without any way to reach it it may as well not be there.\n\nThe way to get it out there is by creating links to your site. These can be <strong>links</strong> in emails, on other website's pages or on search engine results pages, like <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>.\n\nTo get your site to appear in the search engine results you need to let the search engines know that it exists. You can either submit it to the search engines manually or just create links to it from other sites and they will find it and do the rest.\n\nFor more information on building links please see my other article <a href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?p=62\" target=\"_self\">Links, link exchanges and strategies</a>.\n\nIt takes time to build links and get found through the search engine results pages so what else can you do? Well, this may be stating the obvious but tell people. Tell everyone. And I mean everyone. Even the people who you don't think will be interested may know someone who is.\n\nAsk for <strong>feedback</strong>. Approach people and say you need their help and value their opinion. We all love to feel important, valued and that we can help someone else. Send them a link and ask for their feedback. Most of them will take a look and if they've had a quick look it will increase their chances of remembering your site in the future.\n\nWin win win! One of the easiest ways to get people to visit a web page is to incentivise them, put something in it for them. Running a <strong>competition</strong> is good. This will not only pull people in but may also have a viral effect as people forward links to your web page to friends and family. It also provides an opportunity to capture their data (only with their permission, of course) and approach them again in future.\n\nUse <strong>social networks</strong>. By posting a link on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">facebook</a> or <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> you can reach huge numbers of people in minutes and if they like what they see it can really snowball.\n\nIn short, when you're budgeting for a new website like Click here to read more about <a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"http://www.carlsonknives.com\"><font color=\"#555555\">Carlson Knives</font></a> you should add in some budget to launch it or it may not provide you with any value.",

It collapses any content being imported from ad servers. You should see how small the <a title=\"Yahoo!\" href=\"http://uk.yahoo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo! home page</a> becomes without its advertising. There are no more sponsored results on search engine pages, only organic results. It allows you to manually create exceptions, pages where ads are allowed.

When someone visits a website files are copied to the visitor's computer for them to view. Each web page needs a unique address so that people can find it.\n\n<strong>What do you need?</strong>\n\nTo run a website you need three things:\n1) someone to create the files for you,\n2) somewhere to make them available and\n3) a nice name to make it easy to find.\n\nThe process of creating these files is known as <a title=\"web development\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web development</a>.\nThe service of making them available is known as <a title=\"web services\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">web hosting</a>.\nThe name for a site is known as the <a title=\"web services\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=9\" target=\"_self\">domain name</a>.\n\nThese three elements are available as separate services from different suppliers or can often be bought together from one.\n\n<strong>Web Development</strong>\n\nYou need the services of a <a title=\"web developer\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> or <a title=\"web designer\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web designer</a>. In real terms when you're searching for someone to prepare a site for you there's not much difference between the two but a designer is possibly more concerned with the site's appearance and style whereas a developer is more focused on how people use the site.\n\n<strong>Web Hosting</strong>\n\nTo make your site available to the public you need it to be hosted. Web <a href=\"http://www.hostingobserver.com/\" target=\"_blank\">hosting</a> companies have special computers designed for this purpose called web servers. In order to put your website onto the web server and make changes to it your <a title=\"web developer\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> will need access to your hosting account.\n\n<strong>Domain Names</strong>\n\nTo give your site a nice user-friendly name you need to register a domain name with a domain name registrar. There are lots of sites that offer this service including a lot of web developers or hosting companies. The domain needs to be set to point visitors to your hosting account. Instructions of how to do this are usually provided by the hosting company or a <a title=\"web developer\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">web developer</a> will do this for you.",

I've found this out the hard way.\n\nYes, there's no disputing that appearing at the top of the <a title=\"Google UK\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> search results for the right phrases will bring in visitors but using this as your sole strategy could be very risky. You shouldn't be too dependent on <a title=\"Google UK\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> as things can change very quickly.\n\nI've experienced it myself a number of times. I've had my site sitting pretty in the top 5 results only for it to suddenty plummet down to the fourth page or lower or vanish from the search results altogether.\n\n<a title=\"Google UK\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> ranks web pages and other documents by following an algorithm, a complex formula. As they continually try to improve their search technology they tweak this algorithm from time to time. Depending on the change this can have quite dramatic effects on ranking. Through no fault of your own you can suddenly lose your foothold on a particular phrase or market.\n\n<a title=\"Google UK\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> indexes websites by periodically visiting them with it's search robot, <a title=\"Googlebot\" href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=70897\" target=\"_blank\">Googlebot</a>. The frequency of these visits depends on the frequency of your site updates. If you're unlucky enough for your website to be down at the time when <a title=\"Googlebot\" href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=70897\" target=\"_blank\">Googlebot</a> visits you'll drop out of the index and have to wait until it drops by again before reappearing.\n\nThe other big factor is competition. In competitive markets your competitors will be working tirelessly to try to <a title=\"Grab the top spot!\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">grab the top spot</a>. Changes they make to their sites or <a title=\"Search Engine Marketing\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">search engine marketing activity</a> can easily leave you playing catch up.\n\nI'm not suggesting for a second that you should stop pushing for a <a title=\"High Ranking\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp/?page_id=11\" target=\"_self\">high ranking</a> on <a title=\"Google UK\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> but you should be doing other things too so that should anything change your site doesn't grind to a halt.",

It would be very useful to know the effectiveness of each of these activities.\n\nThe easiest way to monitor this is to use specific URLs, one for each activity or source.\n\nInstead of adding a normal link to your page, e.g. <span style=\"color: #800000\">http://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm</span>, you can create unique URLs by adding additional information on to the end of the URL. These additional bits of information are called parameters and values. Here are some examples:\n\n<span style=\"color: #800000\">http://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm?src=homepage\nhttp://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm?src=facebook\nhttp://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm?src=email</span>\n\nTo introduce additional information you add a question mark \"?\" to the end and then a parameter name. This can be anything you like. Here I've used \"src\" short for source. You then have an equals sign \"=\" and set a value against it. Again, this can be anything you like.\n\nIf you're website is database driven your URLs may already have one or more sets of parameters and values in the URL (look for a question mark). If this is the case you simply need to add an ampersand \"&amp;\" on to the end plus your parameter name, an equals sign \"=\" and a value. The ampersand is used to join pairs of parameters and values.\n\nBy adding further sets of parameters and values to the URL you can get more detailed information back. For example, if your contacts database identified people's sex and you wanted to check whether more men or women were visiting your page you could use the URLs:\n\n<span style=\"color: #800000\">http://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm?src=email&amp;sex=male\nhttp://www.yourwebsite.com/event.htm?src=email&amp;sex=female</span>\n\nYou can use this URL monitoring to see which activities are working for you and which are providing the <a title=\"Best value for money\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">best value for money</a> and <a title=\"Return on investment\" href=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com\" target=\"_self\">return on investment</a>.",

There are some grey areas in the terminology used and it's very easy to get lost and not understand precisely what you're being told. Here is a guide to help explain some of the more commonly used terms.\n\nBack in the nineties everyone would talk about <strong>hits</strong>, how many hits they were getting, hit counts, they'd even have a little hit counter on their home page.\n\nSo, what is a hit? A hit means a file that is retrieved from the web server. The key thing to note here is that it's a file, not a page but a file. Therefore, if someone visits a page with 3 image files that's 4 hits, the HTML file plus the 3 image files. A photo gallery page might have 60 thumbnail images in it - that's 61 hits. It's very easy to rack up huge numbers of hits and make it sound like you're getting far more traffic than you are. This is because a lot of people misunderstand hits to mean visits.\n\nA <strong>visit</strong>, sometimes called a <strong>page impression</strong> or <strong>page view</strong>, means one retrieval of a web page from the web server. This term is, at least, what it sounds like. Measuring visits does not take into account the same person visiting multiple times. This is an area to be wary of when paying for advertising on a per thousand impressions or CPM basis. You may get 1,000 impressions, views or visits in a month but it could be only 100 real people who access your page 10 times each. Do not mistake visits for visitors.\n<div style=\"border:solid 1px #CCCCCC;padding:25px;margin:20px;float:right\">\"88.2% of statistics are made up on the spot.\"\n- Vic Reeves</div>\nA <strong>visitor</strong> is a real person, most of the time. As well as people your site may be visited by search engine spiders or robots performing information retrieval tasks. These will all count so you need to be aware that what you see is not 100% what you get.\n\nAnother term that is used is <strong>unique visits</strong> and <strong>unique visitors</strong>. The idea behind labelling them unique is that they are not counted twice. It works either by using cookies or logging IP addresses or often both. It's not perfect as I can visit the same web page from work and home in the same day and be double counted but it's as close as can be realistically expected. The danger with the term unique is that it can have different parameters. Some people use the term unique to mean that the visitor is only counted once for the duration being discussed, e.g. per calendar month. Others use the term unique to mean that each visitor is only counted once in every 24 hour period within the duration. So, if I visit your web page every day in June you could get 1 unique visitor or 30. Quite a difference.\n\nBefore buying a website, domain name, advertising space or anything else where stats are quoted at you, be sure to nail down exactly what you're talking about.\n\nOn the flip side, when trying to sell advertising space, a good solution to overcome any misunderstandings is to use <a title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Analytics</a> on your website. This presents visitor data under clear headings in a way which many webmasters or website owners will understand.",

This has made me all nostalgic so I thought I'd take a quick look back over the last 5 years and how the site and business has changed in that time.\n\nI registered the domain with a company called <a title=\"123 Reg\" href=\"http://www.123-reg.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">123-reg</a> whom I still use to this day. They provide good value domain registration with a nice simple control panel. I also hosted my first site with them though now I have moved on, mainly due to the more advanced technologies I now use.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"float: left;border: 1px solid black;margin: 10px\" src=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/csw2004.jpg\" alt=\"website in 2004\" width=\"210\" height=\"137\" /><strong>2004</strong>\n\nMy first design was fairly basic but, looking back on it now, I still like its simplicity and clarity.\n\nAlthough it was a new site it managed to bring in some good enquiries and before long I was off and running.\n\nI can still remember my first enquiry and the first website I built for a client very clearly.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"float: left;border: 1px solid black;margin: 10px\" src=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/csw2006.jpg\" alt=\"website in 2006\" width=\"210\" height=\"137\" /><strong>2006</strong>\n\nAs the \"cheap web design\" market got more and more competitive I needed to redesign the site to try to improve its search engine rankings. I tried using an individual web page for each individual service I could offer.\n\nWith hindsight, I think what I gained in web traffic I lost in conversions as this design failed to impress web development seekers.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" style=\"float: left;border: 1px solid black;margin: 10px\" src=\"http://www.chris-smith-web.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/csw2007.jpg\" alt=\"website in 2007\" width=\"210\" height=\"137\" /><strong>2007</strong>\n\nAnother year on the web was changing and Web 2.0 technologies were becoming more common. I decided I needed a different design with a fresher, more vibrant feel. This design change saw a marked improvement in my enquiry levels.\n\nI also started using server side technology to create more interactivity.\n\n<strong>Today</strong>\n\nMy site now uses a blogging model and has articles as its centre rather than just the static pages about my services. This model is strong on the search engine side and my visitor numbers are higher than ever. It also means I get to write about the things that I'm passionate about - web development and online marketing.\n\n<strong>The Future</strong>\n\nI'm just in the process of launching a new site focused on <a title=\"Online Marketing\" href=\"http://www.chrissmithmarketing.com\" target=\"_self\">Online Marketing</a>.

How do I do that? How can I make that do this without X, Y and Z happening? You get the idea.\n\nMy first port of call is always <a title=\"Google\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>. The way I see it is that I'm unikely to ever have a technical requirement that somebody else hasn't had before. In fact, it's highly likely that hundreds, even thousands of people have faced the same challenges. By using the right search terms on <a title=\"Google\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> I can usually find the answers to my problems. This inspired me to build a <a title=\"technical blog\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">technical blog</a>. It's my way of sharing what I've learnt and, hopefully, helping someone else out.\n\nAs well as trying to help others it's also tremendously useful to me. Every time I overcome an obstacle I write about it and provide the solution giving <a title=\"code examples\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">code examples</a> where I can. It's very handy to just be able to just come back to it rather than try to remember things that I've done in the past. I also use the site for setting up links to <a title=\"web development resources\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">resources</a> I like and use. Again, it just saves me time looking for things.\n\nMy site is called <a title=\"Dinowebs\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">Dinowebs</a>, <a title=\"Dinowebs\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\">http://dinowebs.net</a>.

I'll share with you how I've achieved this.\n\nMy <a title=\"traffic building strategy\" href=\"http://www.chrissmithmarketing.com\" target=\"_self\">traffic building strategy</a> was to target a few carefully chosen high quality links. My plan was to try to create a small number of links to my site, quality not quatity, coming from web pages highly ranked by <a title=\"Google\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> and with a subject matching the page on my site. I also decided to use deep linking rather than just point everything at my home page.\n\nThe subject of my blog is <a title=\"web development resources\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">web development resources</a> and, in particular, <a title=\"ASP.NET web development\" href=\"http://dinowebs.net\" target=\"_self\">ASP.NET web development</a>. (Two links in that last sentence, sorry, can't help myself.)\n\nWhen I blogged about a particular solution I then went in search (<a title=\"Google\" href=\"http://www.google.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>) of people with technical issues looking for my solution. All I then did was create a forum account and post a reply linking out to my blog post. Highly relevant. I'd respond to forum posts that had been dead for 2 years. Doesn't matter. I'm still getting a link to my site which is good for me and the solution is posted on that forum for anyone who searches in the future.\n\nThe key point is that in this scenario is that the inbound links I have created are actually useful to the linking site's audience. Everybody wins. It's in no way trying to cheat the system. This is the right way to generate your inbound links.",

I'll try to explain it in terms more people can understand.\n\n<a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> is basically about posting short messages, much like SMS texting on mobiles. Each post is called a \"tweet\" and is limited to 140 characters. It can't include other media as such but it can include hyperlinks so anything you wish to share is only a click away.\n\nIt doesn't work like email where you choose the recipients of your messages but more like a subscription service. You put your message out there and it's read by your subscribers. In many ways it's more like broadcasting.\n\nAs a <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> user, or \"Twitterer\", you have the option to \"follow\" other users meaning you subscribe to their broadcasts. Each user has lists of \"following\" - who he/she has chosen to follow and \"followers\" - who is following him/her.\n\n<a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> has 2 real strengths which differentiate it from other networks.\n\nFirstly, the 140 characters limit means it is highly portable and works well with mobile phone applications. For example, it's very easy to let your followers know what you're doing whilst on the move.\n\nSecondly, when you read someone else's \"tweet\" there's a facility to \"retweet\" it, which means instantly broadcasting it to all of your followers. This means that something written by one person can reach millions within a very short time frame. This is what tends to happen with big breaking news stories and this is why it is becoming such a powerful tool for <a title=\"Internet Marketing\" href=\"http://www.chrissmithmarketing.com\" target=\"_self\">marketing</a> and PR.\n\nIf anyone wants to follow me and be alerted to new articles I'm <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chris22smith\" target=\"_self\">@chris22smith</a>.",

    "post_content": "How should you go about selecting the right domain name for your business?\n\nFirstly, you need to find the <a href=\"http://www.hostingobserver.com/free-domain-names.php\" target=\"_blank\">free domain names</a> available on the web. For this, you can take help of your web host. Some <a href=\"http://www.hostingobserver.com/\" target=\"_blank\">web hosting plans</a> include a free domain name with their hosting plan.\n\nSo, once you know where to actually register a name, how do you pick the right one?\n\nTo help demonstrate some different selection methods I'll use the ficticious example of P J Morris, a long established bookshop based in Ashford, Kent.*\n\nIn an ideal world where all possible domain names are available here are a few different ways of approaching it.\n\nFirstly, you can just use the business name. Examples:\n\npjmorris.co.uk\np-j-morris.co.uk\n\nThis works well if your brand is already known to your audience. People in the town who already know the shop would recognise it online and easily remember the domain name.\n\nIf you're looking to build a brand or attract visitors who are not familiar with your business, the domain would need to be very simple and memorable.\n\nSome websites use abstract names, which don't actually describe what the site has to offer, but they are very easy to remember, easy to spell and very brandable. Some examples of this might be Bing.com and Amazon.com.\n\nAnother approach might be to use the business's activity as the main focus. Examples:\n\nbooks.co.uk\nbookshop.co.uk\n\n(remember we're assuming that everything's available)\n\nThese two approaches can, of course, be combined to give the business's name and its activity. Examples:\n\npjmorrisbooks.co.uk\npjmorris-bookshop.co.uk\n\nFinally, you can use the business location in the domain name, either with the business name, the business activity or both. Examples:\n\npjmorrisashford.co.uk\npjmorriskent.co.uk\nbooks-ashford.co.uk\nkentbooks.co.uk\npjmorrisbooksashford.co.uk\npjmorris-books-ashford.co.uk\n\nUsing the business location may help match local searches but may also limit your business's scope to local searchers.\n\nIn the real world, a new site for a book shop would have an enormous amount of competition so combining the name or activity with a geographical reference to successfully match more specific searches is probably a good strategy.\n\nSome general tips:\n<ul>\n\t<li>It's better to avoid using hyphens (-) if possible as people don't remember them.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Try to keep domain names short. pjmorris.co.uk is easy to remember, talk about, give out over the phone and easy to include in any offline marketing, whereas, the other extreme, pjmorris-books-ashford.co.uk, becomes a bit of a mouthful and hard to use.</li>\n</ul>\n* Any resemblance to any real person or business of this name is purely coincidental.",

Which company should you host your site with? How much should you be spending?\n\nThere are a number of factors to consider.\n\n<strong>Disk Space\n</strong>This is the actual physical space on the server for your files. If you're just using text, screen resolution photos and a few icons and graphics then you really won't need much space at all. A few megabytes will do. If you're going to be working with high resolution photos, audio or video files then you might need more.\n\n<strong>Data Transfer\n</strong>This is the amount of data that is downloaded each month. It's a combination of the sizes of files on the site and the number of visitors. If your site is well optimised and you've kept your files as small as can be then, again, you probably won't need much data transfer. With a new site things are usually slow to start of with but then snowball as the site grows. YOu need to keep an eye on the monthly data transfer (your web host should give you this) and upgrade to a higher transfer limit only when you need to.\n\n<strong>Reliability</strong>\nMany web hosts talk about their \"uptime\" - the proportion of time that your site will be up. It's usually 99.9% or higher. With greater reliability comes a higher price tag. YOu have to ask yourself if your site going offline for a short time is really such a bad thing and what it would cost you. Obviously, if you're a massive site like Amazon then being offline for even a minute could cost you thousands but, in reality, for many new sites it's probably better to risk a few minor outages and save money on the hosting.\n\n<strong>Support</strong>\nFinally, it's worth weighing up what kind of support you will receive. If you're new to working with web hosting, managing email accounts or have specialist requirements, e.g. working with ASP.NET, then knowing that there's someone there to help you can be valuable.\n\nWith a new website my advice would be to start small and let the hosting grow with the site. As the numbers of visitors increases you can naturally afford to invest more in your hosting. Only pay for what you need. Start with a small hosting package on a shared server and upgrade as you need to.",

    "post_content": "I started blogging on WordPress back in the summer of 2008. I managed to keep it going through until January 2011, which is quite an achievement in itself. Then, for whatever reason (laziness) it just kind of fizzled out. This was all on my previous site, chris-smith-web.com. I was struggling for a domain name. Can you tell? Don't bother visiting - it just redirects back here these days.\r\n\r\nI started up again on this site, chrissmith.xyz, in late 2014 and am still going in January 2017. Go me!\r\n<h3>When 2 Become 1</h3>\r\nYou've guessed where this is going. I recently had the idea of closing down the old site and importing all the blog posts into this site. Everything in the one place, less maintenance. Easy win. And surprisingly easy to do. Good job, WordPress! When I publish this post it will be my 89th in all. Zoiks! Let's try to hit the ton.\r\n<h3>When I Were a Lad</h3>\r\nI've found it fascinating looking back at some of the things I wrote about in the early days. Cue harp music and wobbly faces. It goes to show how fast things move. Here are some of the topics I covered:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/the-web-20-concept-the-basics/\" target=\"_blank\">Web 2.0</a> - what version are we on now? (Aug 2008)\r\n<blockquote>In the past websites were a one-way read only process, an online brochure which people visited to get information. Now, with the whole concept of Web 2.0, it’s all a two-way interactive process with customers or fans playing an active part in a website.</blockquote>\r\nGold.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/google-chrome-first-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a>, when it was Google Chrome and still in BETA (Sep 2008)\r\n<blockquote>Having another browser on the scene, and with a big name like <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> behind it you know it’s going to have a lot of users, means more testing and increases my chances of having to recode.</blockquote>\r\nHmm. Didn't imagine it would be quite so good.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/links-link-exchanges-and-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\">Link exchanges</a>, when that was a thing (Sep 2008)\r\n<blockquote>Don’t listen to anyone, not even me.</blockquote>\r\nExcellent advice.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/web-design-for-different-screen-sizes/\" target=\"_blank\">Responsive design</a>, kind of, whatever, I'm claiming it (Sep 2008)\r\n<blockquote>The majority of users in the UK use a Windows PC with Internet Explorer 7 and a screen resolution of 1024×768 pixels.</blockquote>\r\nOuch.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nAlthough a lot has changed there's actually a lot of good stuff in there that still holds true. I'm quite impressed. Now I just need to get some other people to read it.",

    "post_content": "Everyone has their favourite big web company and associated operating system (OS). We're all either Apple, Google or Microsoft. Maybe not quite all of us. There's always one weirdo who finds something \"better\".\r\n\r\nI'd say that for office desk based work most people are either on Apple or Windows (Mac or PC). I'm not sure if any significant numbers use a Chromebook and Chrome as their serious OS. I may be wrong. For phones it's iOS, Android or, to a lesser extent, Windows. Do people still use Blackberry in big numbers? I'm assuming not.\r\n\r\nPeople who use Windows for work might have any kind of phone. It's actually pretty unlikely that they'd have a Windows phone as it's smaller in the phone market. On the other hand, I bet almost everyone who uses a Mac has an iPhone. And without even considering any of the other options.\r\n\r\nI'm in quite a lucky position where I work on a Windows laptop, use an Android TV box and an iPad at home so have access to all 3 operating systems. I thought I'd do a quick comparison, nothing scientific, or even particularly fair, just my own impressions. I should also point ut that this isn't about bashing anything. I think all 3 are great. More or less they all do the same things. It's the little differences and the UX of them that becomes interesting. Here are some pros and cons for each.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>iOS and Android are miles ahead of Windows in terms of apps available.</li>\r\n \t<li>iOS is on Apple hardware only whereas you have more choice with Android and Windows.</li>\r\n \t<li>The point of entry in terms of price is much higher for iOS.</li>\r\n \t<li>Android (Material) and Windows have more modern UI whereas iOS doesn't seem to have changed very much in the last few years. Not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation.</li>\r\n \t<li>iOS has Safari as its default browser, which is not quite as feature rich as Chrome or Edge. It's easy to install Chrome though.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor what it's worth, I have a Windows 10 phone (Microsoft Lumia 550) and I absolutely love it. The main drawback is the lack of apps compared with the other platforms but I don't find that to be a major obstacle. Since Windows 10 there's now a first class web browser in Edge so most services which don't have a Windows app seem to have a web equivalent.\r\n\r\nMy phone cost me £55 (about $70) and does everything I need, whereas a new iPhone would probably cost me about 10 times that. My phone doesn't have a great camera or loads of storage, as you'd expect at that low price but I have a digital SLR camera for that. I'm not going to pretend my Windows phone is anywhere near as good in spec compared to the latest iPhone or but I'm also not convinced that my overall mobile experience is 10 times worse. I feel I'm getting the better deal.",

I've no idea but I like new shiny things to play with so have been playing. The <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/computer/neon\" target=\"_blank\">Opera Neon webpage</a> will explain it much better than I can but here are a few first impressions.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/opera-neon.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-494\" src=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/opera-neon-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Opera Neon screenshot\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIt uses your desktop background as its background. Very clever. All it's really doing is copying an image but it changes the whole feel. Rather than looking at a start screen with a white background you're in a familiar environment of your own choosing.\r\n\r\nThe search bar is for keywords or a URL, which is pretty standard, and the way it's presented is nice and minimal with just an underline yet obvious.\r\n\r\nFor your favourite or most recent sites it uses circles with icons rather than screen thumbnails. This makes it feel more like an app start screen, which is quite nice, but I'd probably prefer it to be clearer that they're shortcuts for the websites. There's no URL displayed in a tooltip or taskbar when you hover them, which I always like to see as confirmation of where I'm navigating. Maybe I've just got that switched off somewhere?\r\n\r\nThe layout is very interesting. Open tabs are shown down the right hand side as icons. Key actions and areas like open a new tab or show downloads are shown down the left hand side. It's almost like a typical mobile or tablet view but rotated 90 degrees. This is refreshing and makes a lot of sense. Most websites viewed on a large desktop screen have content within a central column and there's a load of margin on either side, wasted space. By using these areas for the browser it retains the full height meaning we get to see more content on screen. Big thumbs up from me.\r\n\r\nOpera Neon has a built-in snap tool for taking and storing screenshots. It's a camera icon and a gallery icon. Very easy.\r\n\r\nThere's a media player built-in too, so you can listen to music as you browse, which is a neat feature.\r\n\r\nThe page title seems to be repeated. There's one at the very top of the chrome but another internal one at the top of the open tab. As these always seem to be the same it feels a bit redundant.\r\n\r\nIt has dev tools. As it's blink under the hood these are the same as in Chrome though possibly not quite as fully featured to begin with.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm very impressed. It'll be interesting to see if it gains market share.\r\n\r\nJust for future reference, I've been looking at version 1.0.2459.0.",

What if you spend ages learning the shiny new framework and it's gone within 2 years?\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of trends and a lot of new-fangled things do come and go. How do you spot the ones that are going to stick around. It's not easy - you kind of have to go with the flow, not swim against the tide (2 water based metaphors in one sentence, tut).\r\n\r\nIn front end development there are currently a few big JavaScript frameworks - Angular, React and Vue. It seems obvious to me that none of these are going away any time soon. Which do you choose? It really doesn't matter. Learning one in depth, finding its powers and limitations, will help you learn the others or other future technologies.\r\n\r\nIf you're really not sure where to turn I'd focus on core learning. In the front-end world, learn plain JavaScript. With ES2015 and newer versions than that emerging there's still plenty to take on and perfect. That knowledge will always be useful.\r\n\r\nI guess my short answer would be to favour the evergreen HTML, CSS and JavaScript over associated tech like Pug, Sass, TypeScript, etc. As the core technologies get better over time these current convenience technologies may one day not be needed.\r\n\r\nOne word answer.

    "post_content": "Today, 1st Feb, is International box-sizing Awareness Day, apparently. Add it to your calendar now! :) I'm not sure how official that is, or who decided it but it's good to have an annual reminder on some things.\r\n\r\nThe general consensus in early 2017 seems to be that the boffins got the spec wrong on this one and border-box should have been the default, so the first line in a lot of stylesheets or pre-processor files is * { box-sizing: border-box; }. The spec can't change as it would break legacy pages' layout so we're stuck with this fix.\r\n\r\nThat's fine, and I don't believe that using the universal selector * causes any real performance issues. Browsers are fast enough and smart enough to take it in their stride. However, I do hit problems with this reset approach. Frameworks.\r\n<h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>\r\nI've recently tried moving a site which just uses custom CSS and a reset over to Bootstrap 3. Bootstrap uses box-sizing:content-box by default so you chuck in that universal selector and all hell breaks loose. I think that to work with a framework like Bootstrap you have to respect the content-box option and just apply border-box to any custom modules that need it. Basically, if you're using the framework, use the framework, don't half use it.\r\n<h3>Table Cells</h3>\r\nIt's worth noting how table cells behave. They basically have box-sizing border-box by default so padding gets applied inwards. A border between 2 cells gets centered across the cells, so if we have 2 cells with a border of width 10px between them, 5px is effectively within each cell's width.\r\n\r\nYou can change the box-sizing property on a cell to content-box but, in short, don't. It's not clear how this should behave and is inconsistent across browsers.",

That's it, I'm officially done with meaty pizzas. Well, until I forget in a few months, anyway. Embarrassingly, I've been here before.\r\n\r\nIts toppings <em>theoretically</em> included chicken, ham, pepperoni, sausage and sausage meat. They <em>actually</em> included horrible cubes (yes, cubes) of reconstituted chicken, horrible cubes of reconstituted ham, incredibly thin and tasteless pepperoni, little grey cylinders of watery sausage and strange balls of what I'm generously presuming was sausage meat, though it could have been anything really.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that any of it was real meat. There, I'm calling fake meat. If someone told me that it was actually a vegetarian pizza and all the \"meat\" products were actually made from meat substitutes (what's the point?) then I wouldn't be at all surprised.\r\n\r\nI should probably stress that this was a cheap, cook at home in your own oven pizza. I don't want to rubbish all pizzas with meat toppings. I've been to many good restaurants and had very nice real meat topped dishes.\r\n\r\nI think that when it comes to meat in any meal you get what you pay for.

It's an incredibly useful service and getting better all the time so I wonder why I don't use it more. I'm learning slowly. For example, I just wanted to work out 500 divided by 52. In the past I would have opened the calculator programme or app, typed in my request and got my answer. Today, however, I just said this: \"Hey Cortana, what's five hundred divided by fifty-two.\" And, about a second later I had my answer. Much faster.\r\n\r\nI caught myself saying, \"thank you\", and immediately felt like an idiot. But actually, that's not shameful at all, just polite. So what if it was redundant. I'm still human.\r\n\r\nI think there are 2 main reasons why I don't use it more. Firstly, I just don't think of it. I'm a bit set in my ways and am too used to typing. Secondly, I'm self-conscious about using it within earshot of other people. It still feels a bit weird, talking to your computer, and I imagine others who can't hear clearly enough to make out my words wondering who I'm talking to. So, I tend to only use Cortana when I'm on my own, which is even weirder, right? Though, as I never see or hear anyone else using these assistant services I'm guessing I'm probably not alone in this.\r\n\r\nI'm going to try to push through the weirdness and make it more normal in my circles.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, if you're using Cortana, say this: \"Hey Cortana, what does the fox say?\" Do it a few times - you'll get a variety of answers. I guess it probably works on the other assistants too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "I've been thinking about how we might more accurately determine how many times a blog post is read. Not just loaded in a browser but actually read.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are different levels of reading.\r\n<h3>Level 1: Evaluate Source</h3>\r\nThis is just a quick look to see if the post looks worth spending time on. If the page is full of click bait junk then a discerning user might just back out here. If it looks like a decent quality site then the user will hopefully progress to a...\r\n<h3>Level 2: Quick Scan</h3>\r\nThis is reading the post but at high speed and without taking in all the details. The user might skip over any introductory or background content and try to get straight to the meat. When I scan a piece I tend to navigate by subheadings or by reading the first few words of each new paragraph or section.\r\n<h3>Level 3: Full Read</h3>\r\nThis either means the user knows the blog already and trusts its quality or that he/she has the time and interest to read it properly.\r\n<h3>Analysis</h3>\r\nUsing Google Analytics and filtering we can establish the type of visit rather than it just being a page load.\r\n\r\nFirst up, try to filter out any bots, spiders or non human visitors. When you set up a view Analytics has a nice checkbox option for this.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to break the visits down into the levels described above by looking at the length of time on the page. It's not quite a simple as setting fixed ranges as blog posts will vary in length, so what might be a full read for a short piece could be a scan for a longer one. So, we need to use the word count and the time on page to calculate the level. This means we need 3 ranges of reading speeds which reflect our 3 levels.\r\n\r\nSetting the reading speed levels is largely guess work but I've tried to apply some logic to it. Some <a href=\"http://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/technology-research-centers/ereaders/speed-reader/\" target=\"_blank\">reading speed research</a> shows that the average reading speed for an adult is around 300 words per minute. That's five words per second. So, if we get the word count and divide by 5 we've got the rough amount of time in seconds that an adult should need to be on the page to read the whole article.\r\n\r\nSo, if the seconds spent on the page is greater than or equal to a fifth of the word count then we have level 3, the full read.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, what can we discount as an evaluation or bounce? How long can you be on a page before it's considered that you might be scanning its content? I feel this can be a fixed value rather than relative to the word count as our initial evaluation is done very quickly. Unscientifically, this part is really just plucking a number out of the air but my gut feel is for something like 10 seconds. That's taking in 50 words. Below that I find it hard to consider that any content has really been processed. I can't think of a good way to test this out but I may canvas opinion to refine the figure.\r\n\r\nSo, we have a page visit time of less than 10 seconds as our level 1 evaluation. That leaves anything in between as level 2, the scan.\r\n<h3>Fine Tuning</h3>\r\nOf course users could spend time on the page without necessarily reading anything. We can add some other details to increase the accuracy. Using JavaScript we can listen for a scroll event or better see if the end of the post is shown in the viewport and then send this as a dimension. A lack of scrolling or content visibility would certainly help to qualify the evaluation visits.\r\n<h3>Ideas?</h3>\r\nPlease comment if you think of any further refinements or see any flaws in the logic. Thanks.",

It's not really a massive crossword at all, just a large collection of normal sized crosswords. There's a grid of 19x19 squares, each of which leads to a new puzzle.\r\n\r\nI've just completed it, 361 puzzles, 7455 clues in all. That's quite a lot for someone who just likes <em>the odd crossword</em>. The reason I've played it so much is down to the clever way it's designed to hook you in. You see you can't just play any puzzle, you have to buy entry to it with tokens. The app awards you new tokens every day. The clever part is that it rewards you with more for returning on consecutive days so you quickly find yourself starting it up every day so as to maximise your token earnings. Very sneaky.\r\n\r\nIt's completely free but I've seen a lot of banner ads in that time. Ker-ching! It also offers you more tokens in exchange for sharing on Facebook and/or Twitter. Not that I ever did that. I'm not going to start bothering people with my crossword progress. Seems like a sure fire way to lose friends and alienate people.",

It's obvious, it's shorter and the link text actually means something which is better for accessibility and search engine optimisation.\r\n\r\nThe other part that annoys me is that a click isn't really a click any more.

    "post_content": "It's quite an established fact in football that, generally speaking, teams league position follows the clubs' wage bills. The clubs with more resources win more games, get more points and finish higher in the league. There are always exceptions but they are exceptions and the general rule is this alignment between player wages and league position.\r\n\r\nHere is the Premier League ranked by clubs' wage bills for the 2016/2017 season, updated mid January, during transfer window. So, not 100% accurate but certainly indicative.\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Rank</th>\r\n<th>Club</th>\r\n<th>Wage Bill</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1</td>\r\n<td>Manchester City</td>\r\n<td>£225m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n<td>Manchester United</td>\r\n<td>£220.8m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>3</td>\r\n<td>Chelsea</td>\r\n<td>£218m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n<td>Arsenal</td>\r\n<td>£200.5m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>5</td>\r\n<td>Liverpool</td>\r\n<td>£165.6m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n<td>Tottenham Hotspur</td>\r\n<td>£121.2m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>7</td>\r\n<td>Everton</td>\r\n<td>£83m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n<td>West Ham United</td>\r\n<td>£79.8m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>9</td>\r\n<td>Stoke City</td>\r\n<td>£75.9m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>10</td>\r\n<td>Sunderland</td>\r\n<td>£68.3m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>11</td>\r\n<td>Leicester City</td>\r\n<td>£66m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>12</td>\r\n<td>West Bromwich Albion</td>\r\n<td>£65m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>13</td>\r\n<td>Southampton</td>\r\n<td>£63.6m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>14</td>\r\n<td>Swansea City</td>\r\n<td>£59m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>15</td>\r\n<td>Crystal Palace</td>\r\n<td>£55m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>16</td>\r\n<td>Watford</td>\r\n<td>£41m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>17</td>\r\n<td>Bournemouth</td>\r\n<td>£34m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>18</td>\r\n<td>Middlesbrough</td>\r\n<td>£34m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>19</td>\r\n<td>Burnley</td>\r\n<td>£33m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>20</td>\r\n<td>Hull City</td>\r\n<td>£25m</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\nThese positions should be where a club can expect to finish. If they finish higher they have over-achieved; lower and they have under-achieved. Although it's never quite that simple. Another club over-achieving makes it appear that others are under-achieving and vice versa. It's not all within a club's control.\r\n\r\nLooking at the current table today, 7th March 2017, most teams seem on course to finish within one or two positions of their wage bill rank. The notable exceptions are possible over-achievers Tottenham and Burnley and under-achievers Sunderland, Leicester and Manchester United. Though with a good or bad run it could all change.\r\n\r\nWe're constantly looking at the table and teams' positions - if they're in the top 4 or bottom 3 and how many points off these but it doesn't actually make a lot of sense. Yes 2 clubs may have played the same number of games but they haven't played the same opponents. Even half way through the season they haven't played the same home and away opponents. We can only really judge at the end of the season when all the games have been played.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at teams and managers' finishing positions in these terms it can change your perspective. Arsenal get a lot of media criticism for finishing 4th with Arsène Wenger and settling for that but he's consistently hitting his target, which is arguably better for a club than boom and bust, up and down. Roberto Martinez had a tough time with Everton but his achievement of keeping Wigan Athletic in the Premier League for as long as he did was quite incredible. Wigan were a long way below any other side at the bottom in terms of wages and yet he got them to 17th or higher year on year before they eventually couldn't compete any longer.\r\n\r\nIn these terms Burnley and Sean Dyche look like the true winners in 2016/2017 to me.",

    "post_content": "I just discovered how easy it can be to reorganise data in JavaScript before trying to use it.\r\n\r\nI've been working with a third party API so there's no option to change the structure of the JSON which we receive. The data I had was organised by date, an object with object properties giving a new object for each new date. Something like:\r\n<pre>{\r\n  \"2017-03-01\": {\r\n    \"number\": 2\r\n  },\r\n  \"2017-03-02\": {\r\n    \"number\": 3\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nI wanted to bind this data to a list, iterating through it. I know it can be done with a \"for in\" loop but I was using Angular and wanted to use ng-repeat to iterate over an array. So, what I really wanted was this:\r\n<pre>[\r\n  {\r\n    \"date\": \"2017-03-01\",\r\n    \"number\": 2\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"date\": \"2017-03-02\",\r\n    \"number\": 3\r\n  }\r\n]  \r\n</pre>\r\nI don't know why but I'd always assumed that running a function to reformat the data would be a bad idea and would take a lot of time. I converted my data to the desired format. It worked. I then went further and actually broke down several of the original object properties into separate arrays. Each object got had its properties pushed into 7 separate arrays.\r\n\r\nIn my case, looking at a small set of data, under 100 objects, each with around 20 properties, it took about half a millisecond. I timed the reformatting function using console.time(). That's very fast. So fast that it's a no-brainer to reformat the data and have it as you want it. It seems that iterating over object properties and pushing items into arrays or renaming properties is trivial so it makes sense to format the data as soon as it is received.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of a reformatting function, which changes a team object with player object properties into a series of arrays:\r\n<pre>function reformatData(team) {\r\n  var data = {\r\n    playerNames: [],\r\n    appearances: [],\r\n    goals: [],\r\n    assists: [],\r\n    redCards: [],\r\n    yellowCards: []\r\n  };\r\n  for (var player in team) {\r\n    if (team.hasOwnProperty(player)) {\r\n      data.playerNames.push(team[player].name);\r\n      data.appearances.push(team[player].appearances);\r\n      data.goals.push(team[player].goals);\r\n      data.assists.push(team[player].assists);\r\n      data.redCards.push(team[player].cards.red);\r\n      data.yellowCards.push(team[player].cards.yellow);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  return data;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nThe hasOwnProperty() check means that it will only iterate over the objects <em>own</em> properties, not <em>all</em> properties including those inherited from the object prototype. It's safer and keeps it faster.",

    "post_content": "Here's a question on HTML semantics. We now have the not-so-new HTML5 semantic sectioning elements which define areas of the page and try to bring more meaning to it. This is generally seen as a step forward from using &lt;div&gt; which has no particular meaning. Does it always work?\r\n\r\nThere's quite a common design pattern where a wider screen will show the logo and navigation in a sidebar on the left and then in a narrower screen will show it at the top. I've used this myself a few times. Here's a quick illustration of what I mean:\r\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_567\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"200\"]<img class=\"wp-image-567 size-full\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screen-with-sidebar.png\" alt=\"screen with sidebar\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" /> Wider screen with sidebar[/caption]\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_566\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"150\"]<img class=\"wp-image-566 size-full\" style=\"border: solid 1px #000;\" src=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screen-with-header.png\" alt=\"screen with header\" width=\"150\" height=\"200\" /> Narrower screen with header[/caption]\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nMy own website, <a href=\"https://chrissmith.xyz\" target=\"_blank\">chrissmith.xyz</a> currently uses this pattern. I'm using the WordPress theme twentyfifteen with my own child theme over it. The twentyfifteen theme uses an &lt;aside&gt; element for logo and navigation. When I've built my own sites I used the &lt;header&gt; element for this. My feeling was that the content was semantically header information, and that the fact that it appeared on the side on larger screens was not really important. To me &lt;aside&gt; means that the content is supplementary or in addition to the main content whereas &lt;header&gt;, used at the top level, is almost like a fixed part of the page layout template.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it comes down to the content. I've used the &lt;aside&gt; on this site in a fairly static, global way, so really it is a header. The theme creators can't know how the area is going to be used - if it's global or changes with the context of each page, so I guess it makes sense to keep the door open and use &lt;aside&gt;.\r\n<h3>Changing Content</h3>\r\nWe don't necessarily show the same content at different screen sizes. We might show contextual content in the sidebar but on a smaller screen we might choose not to use it. If we change the displayed content with media queries than how can we use semantic sectioning elements correctly? We could have an &lt;aside&gt; and a &lt;header&gt; in our markup but that's a lot of unused bloat.\r\n<h3>Aria Roles?</h3>\r\nMaybe we keep the one element but change the aria-role with JavaScript, e.g. &lt;aside aria-role=\"banner\"&gt;? Or do we go back to a &lt;div&gt; and use aria-roles?\r\n<h3>Replace HTML?</h3>\r\nWe could even switch out the element using JavaScript. Add the other element, append the content to it and then remove the original element. Or just get something different from the server, either by using a cookie or just a parameter in an Ajax request.\r\n\r\nThe example I've given is quite subtle but I can imagine wanting to combine header, sidebar or footer content on smaller screens. How do we handle this and keep it all semantic?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "Presenting content in two or more languages is pretty much a solved problem. The most common way to handle it is to have a language switcher and allow users to flip from a page in one language to the same page content in another language at any point.\r\n\r\nThe print world's equivalent would be putting one language on one side of a sheet of paper and the other language on the other. And then maybe putting a small note about the other language being on the reverse. Both are equal and easy to read, free from the distraction of the other language.\r\n\r\nBut what if you want both? There are cases where it's preferable to keep both languages visible. In Wales the Welsh language is spoken by roughly 1 in 5 people. It was slowly dying out but the government has invested a considerable amount of effort and money into keeping it alive. One of the ways this is done is to keep its profile as high as possible. It should be normal to see Welsh everywhere in Wales. This carries across into digital content too.\r\n\r\nIn print the answer is to display content in 2 columns, one Welsh, one English. Typically, as we read left to right, the Welsh is put first so it is at least acknowledged before non Welsh speaking readers can skip across to the English. It works.\r\n\r\nHow do we do this on the web? Not quite so easy.\r\n\r\nCan we or should we have mixed language content in pages? Does this go against web standards or is it acceptable if done in the right way?\r\n\r\nWe could present a two column layout like in print but then how do we accommodate this on a small screen, like on mobile? Two very narrow columns will give a terrible user experience. If we were to put one above the other, the second language could be pushed a long way down.\r\n\r\nCould we show just the page titles or headings in both languages and then reveal the content in the selected language on click/touch? Possibly. Probably not good for <abbr title=\"search engine optimisation\">SEO</abbr> but maybe it's not possible to have everything.\r\n\r\nI've used a technique previously where I keep the 2 separate language pages but intercept the request and show a full page, like an interstitial ad, which shows the page title and teaser text in both languages. Clicking either redirects to the content in the appropriate language. I refer to it as a \"splash page\" but I'm not sure if this is the right term.\r\n\r\nAre there any other options I haven't considered?

    "post_content": "When we're using relative sizing in CSS, percentages or ems, how precise do we need to be with our fractions? Is there an optimum level?\r\n\r\nIf we have a font size of 18px (or anything, it's relative after all) and we want some smaller text at two thirds of its size (12px) then we can express this as .6666666667em or 66.6666666667%. Here I've used 10 decimal places to give a very precise fraction but this feels like overkill to me. If I used just 2 decimal places, .67em or 66.67%, is this accurate enough to consistently calculate the desired pixel value. Or should I not worry? It'll be near enough.\r\n\r\nLooking at other developers' CSS, mainly in tutorials, the general pattern seems to be to use between 4 and 6 decimal places. Looking back through my own code, my preference seems to be to use 6 but I couldn't tell you why. I'd imagine I've just adopted someone else's coding style. I definitely feel that going beyond 6 seems unnecessary but am not sure how little I can get away with.\r\n\r\nSass is able to perform calculations using fractions. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n<pre>$two_thirds: 2/3 * 1em;\r\n\r\n.smaller {\r\n  font-size: $two_thirds;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nThis resolves to .66667em, 5 decimal places. Is this a set precision or did Sass actually calculate it from the root size and decide what precision was needed for it to resolve to an integer? Hmm (rubs chin). I guess that most people let Sass handle this for them and don't even look at the compiled CSS.",

    "post_content": "I've recently made a load of changes to a site to improve the page loading times. Now that I'm happy it's worked I thought I'd share some of the moves. Broadly, we're looking to load up fewer files and to make each file as small as possible.\r\n<h3>Remove Inline Content</h3>\r\nMy first step was to get rid of any inline styling or scripting, moving as much as possible into .css or .js files so they are recognised as static resources and cached. Moving &lt;style&gt; blocks out into new CSS files or &lt;script&gt; to JavaScript files is pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\nI came across a few instances where these are using some server side binding, something like this:\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n<pre>&lt;script&gt;\r\n  // lots of code\r\n  user.companyName = '@CompanyName';\r\n  // lots of code\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nHere, @CompanyName is coming from the server. This doesn't mean that the whole script block has to stay in the HTML. It's easy to just pull out any server data and stick it in a variable and then move everything else to an external file. Like this:\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n<pre>&lt;script&gt;\r\n  var companyName = '@CompanyName';\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"lots-of-code.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nNow the bulk of the code can be cached.\r\n<h3>Concatenation</h3>\r\nThe next step was to reduce http requests by combining files. You can manually copy all of the CSS or JavaScript into a single file but it's much more practical to do this with a task runner, like Gulp or Grunt. In ASP.NET there's a handy RegisterBundles method which combines files into a single resource for you.\r\n<h3>Minification</h3>\r\nAs well as reducing the number of files we can also reduce the size of files. Minification removes whitespace and comments and often optimises repeated code like variable names to make the file as small as possible. This can be done in a task runner too. In ASP.NET it's an option within bundling - BundlesTable.EnableOptimizations = true.\r\n<h3>Prefetching</h3>\r\nPrefetching is basically going and getting resources and putting them in the cache ready for future use. You just tell your page which resources to get and when it's idle it gets them asynchronously. This means you're shifting the load from your second page onto your first page but without ever affecting the user's experience. The trick is knowing what page he/she will go to next and loading the appropriate resources and trying to avoid loading things which will not be needed. It's particularly effective on stepped processes or wizards.\r\n\r\nThe sites I've been working on had a very light login screen, which upon success takes you to a dashboard. As I knew where the user would be going next it meant that I could prefetch the resources. Obviously I couldn't prefetch anything sensitive that required the user to be logged, like API calls, in but it did mean I could have all of the site wide JavaScript libraries and CSS ready to go. Here's how it looks in the HTML:\r\n\r\n<code></code>\r\n<pre>&lt;link rel=\"prefetch\" href=\"~/bundles/GlobalJS\"&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nEasy, right? As you can see, here I'm prefetching my global JavaScript bundle or concatenated and minified JavaScript resource.\r\n\r\nThe site structure was a series of list pages which each have their own details page to view a record in more detail. I made the assumption that if a user navigated to a list page he/she had the intention of viewing a record. So, from the list page I prefetched the resources needed for the details page.\r\n\r\nThere's a great article on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSS Tricks</a> which goes into far more detail - <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prefetching, preloading, prebrowsing</a>.\r\n<h3>Instant</h3>\r\nLooking at the Page Timings in Google Analytics almost all pages have reduced loading times, some are now even instant. They have no resources to load as everything is already cached. There's still some client side processing to be done after load but I'm happy I've managed to take away most of the user's waiting time.",

I've recently done some work in this area and, whilst I'm satisfied that my changes have improved performance, I can't really be sure to what extent.\r\n\r\nWith any kind of improvement work it's always nice to have a before and after and be able to show the difference. If this can be hard numbers, like in sales, then even better. With web performance can we ever really rely on any numbers?\r\n\r\nI've been using Google Analytics Page Timing reports, specifically the Page Speed Suggestions report, which gives the most popular pages (sorted by page views) and the load time in seconds. I've tried comparing a week before my changes with a week after them. The page load times are different and generally better but it's hard to know if I'm really comparing like with like.\r\n\r\nThere are so many random factors. The number of page views is different for the two different periods. We don't know who the users are, and therefore how much data they're loading. We don't know their locations or devices or their network connection speed. We can find most of this out but then we'd have to find a way of putting it back together in a fair and meaningful way whilst probably still having some unknowns.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that the page load times in Google Analytics are (mean) averages. This means that one extremely slow load can make the average rocket upwards. Conversely, one user hammering the refresh button and getting lots of page views from the cache will make it drop.\r\n\r\nI think that there are 2 ways we can help to measure performance more accurately.\r\n\r\nThe first is just to look at page load times in these reports but wait until we have a larger sample size. As the sample size grows the anomalies are more likely to be diluted and have less of a sway on the overall result. If possible, try to isolate the extreme results, like the fastest and slowest 5%, and remove these from the averages.\r\n\r\nThe second is to use automated load testing so that we're using very similar conditions for each test. Even in this case we'd have to load the page a few thousand times to get a meaningful average result.",

Sometimes you can view items as a list or as cards and there's a mechanism of flipping between them. Gmail has options of Comfortable, Cosy or Compact.\r\n\r\nFrom the developer's point of view, it seems like a nice little extra. It's fairly easy to do in CSS - just toggle a root class on the module and set your styles for each layout.\r\n\r\nHaving done this a few times now, my advice would be a pretty emphatic <strong>don't!</strong> It starts off as a simple variation but it means that every time you make a small change to the content or layout in one layout you have to do this development for each, and then test in each. In short it multiplies out the work.\r\n\r\nImagine offering the user a choice of 3 layouts and 3 colour themes. That's 9 scenarios for the poor tester to check every time you make even the slightest tweak.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with putting work into a UI but in this case the benefit to the end user is negligible for a lot of additional effort. It would be far better to spend the time just doing one layout really well.\r\n\r\nI think there can be occasions where it can work, like just toggling a module font size or line-height but getting into different sets of styling rules is a big no-no for me.",

    "post_content": "I sometimes read things like \"A user will abandon a page if it doesn't load within 2 seconds\". I really don't think these kinds of generalisations are very helpful.\r\n\r\nUsers' expectations vary. They take account of network connectivity and the nature of the information they're accessing. If I abandoned any requests that were not fulfilled within 2 seconds I don't think I'd ever see any web pages on my phone. My expectations aren't that high. I know it's going to take longer and that's fine, up to a point.\r\n\r\nSo, are there benchmarks that we can aim for realistically? We can't just say \"page\" and \"2 seconds\". It needs to also specify the network connection type - wired, WiFi, 3G, 4G, and the page weight in bytes.\r\n\r\nThere's a danger that we strive to keep everything small and light and then give poor experiences on wired desktops with super fast connection speeds. We need to deliver the appropriate experiences.\r\n\r\nWhat's our definition of \"loaded\"? Is it when everything is there and available to use? As soon as there's something to interact with? A sign that something's happening? A use doesn't necessarily need it all. They just need to know that it's coming within a reasonable time frame. There are lots of tactics for keeping a user on side while content is loading too - an entertaining loading animation, flashing up a quote, animating in the various screen elements. As long as there's something to keep the mind from wandering onto something else it's generally fine. Does this distraction tactic feel great the first time but really irritate by the tenth time?\r\n\r\nHow do you benchmark all of that? It's hard, very hard. Maybe that why all we've got is empty generalisations?",

    "post_content": "Until fairly recently I didn't like UI frameworks. I always felt that they would only ever handle half of what the developer actually needed and added a lot of extra unused bulk to the load. Whilst that it still true, to a degree, I now think that there are enough reasons to use a framework which outweigh this concern.\r\n<h3>Maintainability</h3>\r\nAdopting a framework isn't just about the code and the styling. It's about using a well established pattern and way of doing things. The big win for me is that the documentation is all out there. I don't have to write it. So, if I come back to a page in a year's time I'll understand how I've structured the layout. This is also a massive benefit when working with other developers. Having a common standard and style makes it easier for anyone to pick up anyone else's code.\r\n<h3>Consistency</h3>\r\nHaving an opinionated way of doing things ensures that pages within a site are consistent. It's very easy, especially in a large site, to have 3 different ways of doing columns, e.g. floats, display:table and flexbox. <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap</a> helps guide developers towards a common preferred approach.\r\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\r\nHistorically I'm not sure <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap</a> has had the best reputation for accessibility but these days it seems pretty solid. Most of the examples in the documentation show things like roles and screen reader only content (.sr-only), which I probably wouldn't have considered writing my own HTML.\r\n<h3>Efficiency</h3>\r\nUsing a framework means I'm not spending time solving solved problems. It means other people have already invested the time in finding a good way of doing something so that I don't have to. It provides a way of handling most responsive design issues. It may not always be perfect but if you're in a hurry you've got something to work with from the off. I believe that this can really speed up development.\r\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\r\nLearning a framework like <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap</a> teaches you how a framework hangs together so you can write your own. It's very useful to understand what components and utility classes might be needed, how you can combine page elements in containers and how you keep it all maintainable.\r\n<h3>Why Bootstrap?</h3>\r\nPersonally, out of all the available UI frameworks, I'd reach for <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bootstrap</a>. It's the biggest and the best documented (official docs and things like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/twitter-bootstrap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stack Overflow</a> posts). Don't be put off by the look and feel if this is not what you're looking for. It's easy to customise in another layer to look how you want but it does all the layout heavy lifting for you. It's so widely used that if you use a <abbr title=\"Content Delivery Network\">CDN</abbr> there's a good chance the user will already have it all cached so it'll load quickly.",

    "post_content": "The 2016/2017 Premier League season has just finished and so has my season of <a href=\"https://fantasy.premierleague.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fantasy Premier League</a>. After last year being my all time low, with a finishing position of 785,943, this year I've finished 16,876 out of over 4.5 million players. That's in the top 0.4%, which really isn't bad going. I've also won the various mini leagues in which I compete and even won a bit of money. Ker-ching!\r\n\r\nSo, what's been different this year? What have a I learned to propel me up the rankings?\r\n\r\nI think the main difference in the second half of my season was taking notice of the ownership of fantasy assets. In the past I'd always picked the players I'd wanted and not worried about what others were doing. I've come to realise that you can't afford to ignore the market. Getting the right players at the right times affects their value in terms of price rises and drops and your overall team value. It also mitigates risk. If a player is scoring well and well owned then not having him can hurt you and lead to a serious drop in rank. Whereas owning him is less risky. If he does perform you creep up ahead of those who didn't; if he flops it affects a lot of other players too so there's less of a drop.\r\n\r\nThis idea of going with the popular pick is also true of the captaincy. It can hurt if a lot of your opponents pick a captain and he delivers a hi score. Go with flow and you'll be ok. It makes sense to keep your big players in line with the game's leaders and take the risks with the fringe players.\r\n\r\nMy other big learning point was using the chips effectively. This year I kept my second wildcard and bench boost back and used them in gameweeks 36 and 37 where there were an extra five fixtures. Lining up the squad for the double and then having 14 players with 2 fixtures gave me a massive boost. In gameweek 36 I climbed 50,000 places. In gameweek 37 a further 28,000.\r\n\r\nMy final takeaway is that I have tended to write off gameweeks 1 and 38 as a bit of a lottery. With risk of rotation and teams \"on the beach\" it can be hard to predict. However, there always seem to be a lot of goals in these games. It may be worth investing more in attacking players and even risking the All Out Attack chip or Triple Captain. A very late Triple Captain chip could bring about quite a swing in fortunes if the right payer gets a hat-trick.\r\n\r\nHere's the story of my season, and of seasons gone by, in stats:\r\n<a href=\"https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/entry/408653/history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://fantasy.premierleague.com/a/entry/408653/history</a>",

    "post_content": "When working with web apps or more complex sites where the user has to work through a process a product tour can be a very useful addition. In case it's not clear from the name (I'm not sure I'd have known) a product tour is basically a series of tooltips which appear and guide the user through using the page/app in steps.\r\n\r\nHaving the help or guidance right there in the page is much neater than providing a separate help page or subsite. It's not always easy flicking back and forth between the screen your working on and the documentation.\r\n\r\nThe other great benefit is that you don't have to just show the tooltips as hints. You can actually tell the user what to do and the tour advances as they do it. So, they're actually using your site and you're helping them through it.\r\n\r\nIf implemented well this could mean the end of lengthy, hard to maintain documentation, training materials, videos, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are a few libraries out there for this but, of the ones I've looked at, the best for my needs was <a href=\"http://linkedin.github.io/hopscotch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hopscotch</a> by LinkedIn. It's vanilla JavaScript, very simple to implement and has some nice added features like support for other languages.\r\n\r\nYou define a tour object with an array of steps. Each step then has an element selector, the bubble content and the position where you want it to appear - top, bottom, left, right. That's it.\r\n\r\nYou can also do some pretty clever stuff where your tour goes across multiple pages. This just needs you to pass the tour ID and step index so it knows where to pick up from.\r\n\r\nThe Hopscotch demo page explains it all very nicely:\r\n<a href=\"http://linkedin.github.io/hopscotch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://linkedin.github.io/hopscotch/</a>",

Hopefully not.\r\n\r\nI've hit this issue recently using PhantomJS to turn HTML content into a PDF. It generally works pretty well but when you get into tables with collapsed borders and use rowspan and colspan things start getting a bit hairy and some of your borders just don't get rendered. Sad face.\r\n\r\nNo amount of messing with border-collapse, display or border properties seems to have any affect. So, what can we do? Time to get dirty and hack our way out of it. Surgical gloves on.\r\n\r\nWe can't change the borders so we create pseudo borders. We use CSS pseudo elements to create lines within the cells. Here's the CSS for a top-border:\r\n<pre>.hacked-border-top {\r\n  position:relative;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.hacked-border-top:before {\r\n  background-color:currentColor; /* or whatever */\r\n  height:1px;\r\n  left:0;\r\n  position:absolute;\r\n  top:-1px;\r\n  width:100%;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nThe pseudo border is absolutely positioned within the cell, thickness (height) 1px, full width. The top:-1px moves it outside the box model to where the border would be.\r\n\r\nChange the height, width and bottom, left, right and top values as need be for the different sides.\r\n\r\nPlease only use this as a last resort when all else fails.\r\n<div style=\"border: solid .5em #c00; border-radius: 1em; color: #c00; display: inline-block; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: bold; margin: 1em; padding: 1em; text-transform: uppercase;\">In case of emergency break glass</div>",

    "post_content": "There are a few ways of using conditionals in JavaScript. I've started thinking about it again as I've just discovered another new way.\r\n\r\nLets start off with some basic set up stuff for our examples - a variable, which can be true or false and functions to use in either case:\r\n<pre>var isAllowed = false;\r\n\r\nfunction admit() {\r\n  console.log(\"admitted\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction reject() {\r\n  console.log(\"rejected\");\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nThe first way I learned to write a conditional, which I consider the classic way, is with if and else clauses like this:\r\n<pre>if (isAllowed) {\r\n  admit();\r\n} else {\r\n  reject();\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nIf you don't need the else part, you can do it in one line, leaving out the curly braces like this:\r\n<pre>if (isAllowed) admit();\r\n</pre>\r\nAnother way of writing it is to use a ternary operator. The first part before the question mark is evaluated. If it's true the next part between the question mark and colon is used; if false the last part after the colon is used:\r\n<pre>isAllowed ? admit() : reject();\r\n</pre>\r\nIf you want this style of expression, without actually writing \"if\" but you don't want the else part there is yet another way.\r\n\r\nLook at this:\r\n<pre>!isAllowed || admit();\r\n</pre>\r\nWeird, eh? With an OR expression using ||, the first part is evaluated or run if a function. If true it stops there. If false it evaluates or runs the second part. In case you're new to this, the ! means NOT or inverts the meaning. So, we're saying if isAllowed is false, stop; otherwise run the admit() function.\r\n\r\nIt's the same technique often used to set default values, just turned around:\r\n<pre>var carModel = getCarModel() || 'unknown';\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIf you're free to use any of these I'd probably advise sticking to the classic if (else) with the braces. It's so much more readable and can be understood by a developer at any level. I like the last technique but I'd only use it in solo projects or where I can't use anything else.",

For example, I have loads of Sass files. These get compiled into CSS before being concatenated and minified - turned back into the single big file. Working this way has several advantages. It's easier to work in smaller files - easy to find the line you need with minimal scrolling. It paves the way for using web components of a component system where styles of scripts can be embedded within the component, making it a true standalone piece of the document. Finally, it makes it easy to build dependency free components in a tool like CodePen. You can just write the HTML, Sass and JavaScript and save it as an isolated component with its own demo.",

    "post_content": "When looking at making UX improvements to web apps, I tend to obsess about speed and performance. For me a fast experience is a good experience.\r\n\r\nI really think that speed outweighs all other factors. If you can keep all loading and waiting times very short, ideally under a second, it keeps the user engaged and efficient in what they're trying to achieve. As soon as anything takes longer than a couple of seconds it's easy to let your mind wander, switch context and then take longer to get back into what you were doing. If this is happening lots of times across a lengthy session it really adds up, not to mention the frustration it causes.\r\n\r\nUsability is obviously important too. It needs to be obvious what screen elements you can interact with - is that an underlined heading or a link? It needs to be clear what an interaction with that element will do. Unexpected behaviour makes people feel uneasy and suspicious about other potential interactions. And it's always good if the user can see how the whole piece fits together, how you get from A to B, B to C, etc.\r\n\r\nThe usual causes of things being slow are not network issues but bad design. The most common problem is simply trying to send too much too soon. Requirements often ask for a high number of items to be displayed with a high level of detail against each. It's always worth asking if this can be broken down to show fewer items or less detail with more being available on demand.\r\n\r\nIf a screen lists 20 items with all their details and it's taking 5 seconds to load we still don't have to load it all at once. Rather than the user waiting for 5 seconds, why not just load the first 3 items quickly, so the user has something to see within a more acceptable time frame (before the mind wanders), and then load the other 17 in the background while the first 3 are keeping them occupied.\r\n\r\nEven if your app is working at acceptable speeds if you haven't already done so you should still try to make it faster. Use a strategy for how you're going to load new data and use the usual performance tricks - caching, bundling, minification, pre-fetching - to really give the UX a boost.",

    "post_content": "I'm trying to work out when it's best to put attributes in the DOM and when it's best to just leave them in JavaScript objects. This is going to be hard to explain so bear with me.\r\n\r\nLet's suppose we have a list of users on a page. Each user has a number of properties, not things we'd display like name, age and gender but hidden things like permissions, e.g. isAdmin, canComment, isManager, etc. These properties are going to be used in logic to determine how things are displayed on screen - maybe an extra bit of detail or an icon. Just as an example, if canComment is true then a speech bubble icon will appear.\r\n\r\nThe basic HTML might look something like this:\r\n<pre>&lt;ul&gt;\r\n  &lt;li id=\"001\" class=\"user\"&gt;John&lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;li id=\"002\" class=\"user\"&gt;Paul&lt;/li&gt;\r\n  &lt;li id=\"003\" class=\"user\"&gt;George&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\nBehind this is a JavaScript object, like this:\r\n<pre>var users = [\r\n  {\r\n    id: '001',\r\n    name: 'John',\r\n    canComment: true\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: '002',\r\n    name: 'Paul',\r\n    canComment: false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: '003',\r\n    name: 'George',\r\n    canComment: false\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n</pre>\r\nSo, user John is allowed to comment and we want to show an icon. There are 2 approaches:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3>Use the DOM</h3>\r\nWe could add the icon inside each &lt;li&gt; and then add a class (class=\"user can-edit\") or a data-attribute (data-can-edit) to the &lt;li&gt; and use CSS to display it as appropriate, e.g. .user[data-can-edit] .icon { display: inline-block }.</li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3>Use JavaScript</h3>\r\nOr, we could write a JavaScript function to filter the objects to just those with canComment set to true, get their ids, and then loop through the list items adding the icon HTML when the ids match the filtered list.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThe first approach puts the property into the DOM, puts the icon into the DOM and then uses CSS to show/hide it. It feels easy. The icon is always sat there waiting, like an unchecked checkbox, only shown when needed (checked). There is still logic but it's done up front. The DOM is actually human readable and it's easy to see which users can and can't edit for debugging purposes. I see this approach used a lot, including the hidden DOM elements, usually because of the way templates or components are used. It's easier to include it and pass a property to toggle whether or not it displays. It also means that if we want to change the property during the lifecycle of the page, e.g. take away John's commenting permission, it's minimal change to the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe second approach only touches the DOM to insert the icon where needed. It does all the logic in JavaScript and the output in the DOM reflects what the user actually sees on screen. There are no hidden elements. This has advantages when it's scaled up, in that it keeps the DOM lighter and there's no waste. The JavaScript is incredibly fast in modern browsers so the functions won't slow anything down, especially if using .filter(), map(), etc. The trick here is not to loop through and add the icons one at a time but to run through building the whole list and just doing the one insert or replace operation. This makes the DOM less readable as all the canComment data is in JavaScript.\r\n\r\nSo, is it better to use the DOM for data or keep it in JavaScript?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

What's odd is that the models for the accounts vary quite considerably.\n\nFor banking, gas, electricity and water my wife and I have joint accounts - we are jointly responsible and either of us can make changes. Where they offer online services, we each have our own login but are presented with exactly the same data. It's quite a standard user setup from a system point of view.\n\nA lot of online only services still work on a single one account one person basis. We use Amazon Prime. We've both had Amazon accounts for years but when it comes to upgrading to Prime we're not both going to pay the premium. And if we want to read the same Kindle ebook we're not going to buy it twice. So, we end up using the one account and Amazon, who are famous for their user behaviour tracking and algorithms, lose sight of one of their users and what's really happening. That can't be good for them either.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Netflix seem to have recognised the need for shared family accounts - it's one subscription per household, not one per person. You set up each user with their own login and they can then save their own favourites, watch lists, game progress, etc. It also allows parental control over children. It's secure too - limited to a single local network so you can't go giving access to anyone outside of that.\n\nI think more services need to recognise how things are really used and adapt their account models to fit.

I couldn't really care less and I don't think anyone else could either, which is kind of the whole point.\r\n\r\nI'm not leaving it or deleting my account, just breaking the cycle of checking it twice a day or more and posting just to perpetuate others' habits.\r\n\r\nSo, why the step back? For a while I've felt uneasy about the addictive nature of it. I reached a stage where even though I didn't particularly like it any more I was still feeling scared of missing out. I thought I'd initially just not look at it for a week and see if I missed it. I didn't. And I haven't been back on since. For about a  month. Now I really sound like an addict. :)\r\n\r\nI found that even though I have 150+ \"friends\", there weren't many active users. I was only interacting with the same handful regularly. I also think that there are probably a whole host of others who just go on, read, but never post or interact - just voyeurs. This not knowing who's watching/listening makes me uneasy. I post on Twitter but that's just public. I only write on there anything that I'm happy for anyone to read, and it's generally very dull unless you're really into web development when it's just moderately dull. :)\r\n\r\nAnother issue for me was that it was making me dislike people who I do genuinely like in real life. People present a persona on social media and it can be quite different from the real person.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of bragging, attention seeking, fishing for compliments and campaigning, all of which I can live without.\r\n\r\nSome people, who are great company in reality are just painfully boring on Facebook. There are a lot of what I'd call \"single issue posters\". So, everything from that person is about a political party, a sports team, a band or their kids. Sorry, it's not personal, but I just don't share your interest.\r\n\r\nIt's not all ridding myself of a terrible affliction. There is a down side too. There are a few people who post the occasional gem which makes me laugh a lot. And I do get to hear about some things that interest me.\r\n\r\nI can't help feeling that the people who really matter to me still matter without Facebook. Whereas I once saw Facebook as a convenient tool for keeping in touch and extending reality, it's now become something else, a place for people to present themselves through very controlled filters. Everyone's doing a PR job on themselves.\r\n\r\nI'll probably be back at some point but for now I just feel better staying well away from it all.",

I'd say that of the developers I have worked with, some have clear IT backgrounds, e.g. Computer Science degrees, others are entirely self-taught. As far as I can tell, as long as they have enough experience, it doesn't seem to make a lot of difference. Controversial?\r\n\r\nBeing self-taught myself, I'm not actually sure what is taught in school and universities but, from my limited experience of working in a college and from knowing what my kids learn, it feels like it's always well being the curve, at least 2 or 3 years behind what's being used in the industry. This is both in terms of tooling and approach.\r\n\r\nMy kids have recently been learning to do various tasks in Excel. They'll spend a week on something that I feel could be picked up in a couple of hours. For me, you'd get a lot more out of Excel by investing time in learning mathematical functions. And learning to use the import/export functionality. But that side of things is never taught.\r\n\r\nLots of courses include modules on the history of computing, the Difference Engine. Whilst interesting, does it really help? In fact, I'm not sure that any time spent on how things used to be done is really very useful. Keep looking forwards, not backwards.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what employers look for now or will look for in the future but I feel there could be more value in other subjects like maths than IT. IT is too broad, too \"Jack of all trades, master of none\", and without any depth lacks real value. It's easy to teach yourself whatever you need to learn in IT - there are so many good quality resources. I'd be inclined to learn other things and then demonstrate your IT skills through your own projects - websites, apps, APIs, etc. This will not only let you develop your other skills but give you experience of being self-sufficient in tech. It will also prove you have the motivation and discipline to teach yourself, which I think is essential.\r\n\r\nJust my view. Please feel free to argue the case for the quals...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

There are good reasons for this, consistent appearance across browsers and devices being the main one. However, there's a lot more to consider than just how it looks.\r\n<h3>Form Controls</h3>\r\nLet's think about something like a slider switch in place of a good old fashioned checkbox.

It wasn't so much about learning new tech and tools as just getting back to basics and doing things better.\r\n<h3>Simplifying Things</h3>\r\nI've learned to keep things simple and not make them more complicated than they need to be. I actively try to write less JavaScript, doing more with HTML and CSS, and trusting native form controls instead of trying to re-invent them.\r\n\r\nA good example might be something like a list of text items where we want the currently selected item to be bold. We could use JavaScript to set the style of the selected item and add click events to change the state of each item but we don't need to. When we just look at the requirement and what is actually happening, it can be done with a radio button list. Just add radio buttons each with a unique  ID but the same name attribute. Put a label after each referring to it with the for attribute. Finally use CSS to hide the input and apply a style to :checked + label. Done. It's a radio button list in disguise. Not only is it much simpler code but it's accessible as a non screen user just sees a standard radio button list.\r\n<h3>Components</h3>\r\nIn the world of Angular, and starting to explore the more recent versions, I've got used to using components. As a front end developer/designer it's been great to be able to build a small standalone snippet of HTML/CSS in CodePen. By having it small and isolated it makes it easy to test in browsers, linting tools, accessibility tools, etc. It's like unit testing for functions.\r\n<h3>Sass (SCSS)</h3>\r\nI came to Sass very late but it hasn't taken long for it to become the norm and writing standard CSS now just feels weird and like hard work.\r\n<h3>Accessibility</h3>\r\nIn the last couple of months I've made a conscious effort to improve accessibility. I've started using <a href=\"https://www.deque.com/products/axe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aXe</a> accessibility checker and guidance from the Accessibility Project site, <a href=\"https://a11yproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a11yproject.com</a>. It's a big area and an important one so more about that in another dedicated post.\r\n<h3>Xamarin</h3>\r\nI've dipped my toe into the waters of cross platform development with Xamarin. It allows you write code in C# and export separate versions for iOS, Android and Windows. There's still some platform specific quirks but it's about 90% reusable and the framework makes it manageable. It now supports <em>some</em> CSS too as well as it's own style rule syntax so should be easier.\r\n<h3>Adobe Illustrator</h3>\r\nFinal one on my list is that I've now got Illustrator. I don't really know what I'm doing yet, still Googling each new thing I need but it's an amazingly powerful tool. It's been great for creating alternate versions of logos, converting PNGs to SVG and optimising existing images.\r\n<h3>2018?</h3>\r\nI'm not sure what 2018 holds. I think I might actually start doing some training, focusing on HTML and CSS.",

The scenario is a biggish set of data, 100,000 records, with each record having 3 properties, and we want to filter them using text matching.\r\n\r\nHere is the finished article with dummy generated data. Give it a try. Just type any 3 or 4 characters and watch it do its thing.\r\n\r\n[codepen_embed height=\"520\" theme_id=\"dark\" slug_hash=\"mXeMGL\" default_tab=\"result\" user=\"chris22smith\" editable=\"true\" data-editable=\"true\"]See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/00100ee0eafe1e6d77c88ba7a387b7aa/\">Fast Filtering with JavaScript</a> by Chris Smith (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith\">@chris22smith</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nFast, isn't it? You can go into the JavaScript tab and see how it all works but I'll explain some of the main parts.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to make it fast the most important thing to be aware of is that changing JavaScript objects is fast, changing the DOM is slow. So, we do as much as we can in JavaScript and then just update the DOM at the end. If you try to create 100,000 &lt;li&gt; tags it will be very slow and will probably die on you.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to set up a function to convert the data array into a HTML list. We keep this fast by setting a limit on how many items we will show. In this demo I've set it to 10 but even increasing it to 100 makes little difference to the speed. They key thing is not to get into big numbers which put a strain on the DOM. So we don't loop through all the items, only the first few. A nice small loop, which runs quickly.\r\n\r\nThe building is all done in JavaScript, with nothing touching the DOM until we have a complete Document Fragment with all the list items ready to append to our list. I've separated out the building of each list item into its own function to hopefully make this even faster. Whenever iterating through large numbers of records the more variables and functions we can take out of the loop and pre-define the better.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to get the data array with the full data and filter it down into a smaller array using the native JavaScript filter() method. This method is incredibly fast, much quicker than using a for loop to iterate through each item. You can read more about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filter() on MDN</a>. If you use a predefined function with it rather than an anonymous function it's faster still.\r\n\r\nOnce we have the filtered down array we can call our function to rebuild the list in HTML. It all happens in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nAs a final touch I've added a count message function which gets called each time we filter. This just helps to see what's going on - how many records are being shown and the size of the reduced data set.",

    "post_content": "FPL players range in cost starting from 4 up to 13 so how do you compare them fairly across such a broad spectrum? What sort of returns should you expect from each price bracket? I've tried to apply some (very rough) maths to it to find out who's justifying their price tag.\r\n<h3>Season Target</h3>\r\nFirstly, we need to set a points target for the season to get our weekly target. I'm going to base mine on equalling my best ever season, 2016/2017, where I scored 2281 points, with a rank of 16,876. So, for this, I'm using a season target of 2280 points, which as you'll see further down makes the maths easier.\r\n<h3>Scope and Disclaimers</h3>\r\nThe next thing is to set the scope of this exercise and get in my disclaimers. I'm assuming 38 \"normal\" game weeks with no hits and no chips. I'm also ignoring rises in team value. Finally, I'm giving all figures rounded to 2 decimal places.\r\n<h3>Team Value</h3>\r\nSo, breaking things down, we all start with a team value of 100. This means each of our 15 squad players averages out at a cost of 6.67 (100/15).\r\n\r\nOnly 11 of our 15 score each week so we need to focus on the team rather than the squad. I've assumed that our first 11 have a cumulative cost of 82. That's assuming a typical value of 18 on bench, something like 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 5.0.\r\n\r\nUsing that total playing cost of 82, each player now has an average value of 7.45 (82/11).\r\n<h3>Weekly Target</h3>\r\nGoing back to my season target of 2280 points. Over 38 game weeks this (conveniently) breaks down to 60 points per week. So, I have a weekly target of 60 points.\r\n<h3>Player Target</h3>\r\nThe next thing to work out is the average return required from each player each week. Given that our captain scores double this is the game week requirement divided by 12, 60/12 = 5. So, I want each player to score 5.\r\n<h3>Expected Returns</h3>\r\nIf I'm expecting an average of 5 points from an average player cost of 7.45 that means I'm expecting each player to return 0.67 of his cost in points. Roughly two thirds. So, a player worth 12 should return 8 points, a player worth 9 should return 6, you get it.\r\n<h3>Value Index</h3>\r\nWe can then take this expected return number and divide by 0.67 to give a value index based on 1, where 1 is the expected value, above 1 is better, below 1 is poorer.\r\n\r\nWe can estimate the value over the season so far by looking at the Points per Match and comparing that with the cost. If PPM divided by cost is less than 0.67 the player's returning lower than expected, if higher it's better. This index makes it easy to see how much better or worse as a percentage. 1.14 = 14% better, 0.92 = 8% worse.\r\n<h3>Real Examples</h3>\r\nHere are some examples using stats from mid game week 28, 2017/2018 season.\r\n<h4>Defenders</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Player</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th><abbr title=\"Point per Match\">PPM</abbr></th>\r\n<th>Value Index</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Alonso</td>\r\n<td>7.2</td>\r\n<td>5.3</td>\r\n<td>1.10</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Davies</td>\r\n<td>5.7</td>\r\n<td>5.2</td>\r\n<td>1.36</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Valencia</td>\r\n<td>6.9</td>\r\n<td>5.1</td>\r\n<td>1.10</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bellerin</td>\r\n<td>6.0</td>\r\n<td>3.7</td>\r\n<td>0.92</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Bruno</td>\r\n<td>4.5</td>\r\n<td>3.3</td>\r\n<td>1.09</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4>Midfielders</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Player</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th><abbr title=\"Point per Match\">PPM</abbr></th>\r\n<th>Value Index</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Salah</td>\r\n<td>10.5</td>\r\n<td>8.4</td>\r\n<td>1.19</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>De Bruyne</td>\r\n<td>10.4</td>\r\n<td>6.4</td>\r\n<td>0.92</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Hazard</td>\r\n<td>10.7</td>\r\n<td>6.0</td>\r\n<td>0.84</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Ramsey</td>\r\n<td>7.0</td>\r\n<td>5.8</td>\r\n<td>1.24</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Doucoure</td>\r\n<td>5.5</td>\r\n<td>4.2</td>\r\n<td>1.14</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h4>Forwards</h4>\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Player</th>\r\n<th>Cost</th>\r\n<th><abbr title=\"Point per Match\">PPM</abbr></th>\r\n<th>Value Index</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Kane</td>\r\n<td>12.9</td>\r\n<td>6.4</td>\r\n<td>0.74</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Firmino</td>\r\n<td>9.3</td>\r\n<td>5.5</td>\r\n<td>0.88</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Rooney</td>\r\n<td>7.2</td>\r\n<td>4.4</td>\r\n<td>0.91</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Murray</td>\r\n<td>5.7</td>\r\n<td>3.5</td>\r\n<td>0.92</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Wilson</td>\r\n<td>6.0</td>\r\n<td>4.3</td>\r\n<td>1.07</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3>Observations</h3>\r\nFrom these few selected players in the examples, we can see that the best performing for their cost is Ben Davies of Spurs with 1.36; the worst is surprisingly Harry Kane with 0.74.\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\nThere are obviously other factors like minutes played but maybe we can use this value index to see which players perform consistently when selected. Maybe using point per match based on recent form rather than the season average would yield more accurate results?",

This isn't about design techniques or theory, just how to interact with other people.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rule 1. Don't be a dick.</strong>\r\nThat's really it. Don't let your ego take over. You will inevitably have to present your work to others. Don't presume that because you're the designer that your opinion is worth more than anyone else's. It's a collaborative process and if you start feeling that you know best it will stop you listening to others. This leads neatly into...\r\n\r\n<strong>Rule 2. Listen to others.</strong>\r\nThis isn't because you have to or to be polite. If you actually listen and understand people's views, opinions and concerns you can learn how to adapt your designs to meet their needs or explain how there might be a different solution to the problem.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rule 3. Explain your thinking.</strong>\r\nDon't just present a design and let others judge it. Explain clearly all of the design decisions you have made. If you can justify these and articulate them clearly people will understand, you'll have more of a conversation and, in turn, their feedback will be more constructive. It will also give them more faith in you - you don't do things on a whim but your decisions are well thought out.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rule 4. You don't have to win.</strong>\r\nIt's ok to not get your way. It's important to show that you respect others' opinions and concede to try their ideas. If their idea really was wrong it will come out over time and the next time they will be more inclined to trust your view.",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's a common design pattern these days where a bit of content is shown over the main screen. It might be a modal window or maybe a fly-in menu or sidebar. It's also common, especially in native apps, that we can just click or tap in the space not used by these elements to close them. So, how can we do this?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think there are 2 approaches, one which is pure JavaScript and another which involves an overlay element. Let's look at both.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>JavaScript Document Click Event Method</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can detect that a click is not on the content element using JavaScript. As all click events bubble up or propagate through the DOM tree they eventually reach the top document level. We can listen for a click on the document and then use the event target to check what was clicked. For this example let's assume our content element has a class of 'modal', like &lt;div class=\"modal\">&lt;/div>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>// JavaScript\n\nfunction handleClick(event) {\n  if (!event.target.closest('.modal')) {\n    console.log('close');\n  }\n}\n\ndocument.addEventListener('click', handleClick);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>event.target gets the element that was clicked. This could be the modal element itself, another element inside it or another element outside of it. event.target.closest('.modal') checks if the element clicked is the modal or is an antecedent of the modal element, an element within it. If the element clicked is not (!) in the modal we can close it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's maybe worth noting that .closest() doesn't work in IE11 if you need to support this but there is a polyfill available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Using an Overlay Element</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other approach, and the one I tend to use, is to use an overlay element. This means adding an element that covers the whole screen area, slipped in between the modal and the main screen content. The idea is that this overlay will appear and disappear along with the modal and will pick up any click events which are not on the modal. It's a bit like a safety net that will catch any stray clicks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The CSS for the overlay would typically look something like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>/* CSS */\n\n.overlay {\n  background-color:#000;\n  bottom:0;\n  left:0;\n  opacity:.5;\n  position:fixed;\n  right:0;\n  top:0;\n  z-index:1;\n}\n\n.modal {\n  /* styling */\n  z-index:2;\n}</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The overlay has fixed display and goes to each edge so it fills the screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The overlay has z-index set to 1 so it's over the main screen content, and the modal has it set to 2 so it's over the overlay. These can increase as needed but the modal always needs to be higher.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've given the overlay a background colour and 50% (.5) opacity so that it veils the main screen content underneath giving the modal a \"lightbox\" effect but these are not needed and our overlay can be effectively invisible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You then just add a click event to the overlay which will close the modal and hide the overlay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reason I like this approach is that by covering the main screen we prevent any interactions with it. If the user tries to click on a button under the overlay their first click will just close the modal. We don't need to worry about any other interactions - while the modal is showing it becomes the sole focus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Extra tip. If you use a visible overlay it's nicer not to show and hide it immediately but fade it in and out with a transition on the opacity, taking it between 0 and .5. This feels much smoother and less jerky.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "I've been putting images in web pages for years. Nearly 2 decades now. For most of that time it has been quite easy. Add your source and the dimensions and BOOM, there you go. There was always some work around optimising images outside of your page but once in there, easy.\r\n\r\nThen, with higher pixel densities it started getting a bit harder and we had to work it out with media queries and srcset. Now SVG is widely supported, all this fussing around with different versions for different resolutions has gone away, at least for simple graphics.\r\n\r\nI've recently been doing some design work on an Android app and it's a very different way of doing things with images. For example, I've created a splash screen for while the app is loading. It's a full page, wide logo in the centre, coloured background.\r\n\r\nOn the web, I'd just set the background colour and then centre the SVG logo, probably with flexbox, and use a flex-basis of 80% or some margin to give it a flexible width.\r\n\r\nOn Android, I've had to provide the splash screen image as a series of PNG files. 5 different resolutions, varying from 480x320 up to 1920x1280, and then in both orientations, 10 files in all. The clever part is that at the point of installing the app the Android device will only get the files appropriate for its size and pixel density but it means a lot of messing around with assets.\r\n\r\nIt's been a similar story for icons too. Multiple resolutions. You want a different colour? That's a separate PNG.\r\n\r\nI'm making it sound worse than it actually is. Luckily there are great tools that let you import a single image and export all the variations you could need.\r\n\r\nBut it does make you think about the differences between platforms. To me, the web browser, with it's ability to resize on the fly, use SVG, recolour, apply filters, transform and animate in CSS makes Android image support feel very primitive.",

For a long time I've just slapped my icon down on the page, styled it and added a click event where needed. Job done.\r\n\r\nHaving spent some time looking a bit more deeply into accessibility, I can now see that this is not a great approach. There's more to consider. If you can't see it what is it actually doing?\r\n\r\nHere's how I approach using icons now. It may not be the perfect solution but it's certainly a lot closer than most use cases I see. The way I use HTML depends on the use case.\r\n\r\nIf the icon is purely decorative - there in addition to text, e.g. a floppy disk icon next to the word \"Save\" on a button, then I think we can reasonably just forget about it and hide it for non screen users. A simple aria-hidden=\"true\" attribute should do.\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;button&gt;&lt;i class=\"fa fa-save\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Save&lt;/button&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nIf it is there as an indicator, in place of a label, like where a hotel might have icons for TV, bath, etc. then we can use an &lt;span&gt; to wrap it. Inside the span we add our icon and another span with a text alternative. We show the icon and hide the inner span for screens, show the text only for other media.\r\n\r\nFinally, if the icon is interactive and acts like a link or button, let's make it a link or button. Like the previous example, use the &lt;button&gt; or &lt;a&gt; tag to wrap the icon and a span text alternative and show/hide for the appropriate media. This has the added bonus of making it possible to tab to the icon and so use just the keyboard to navigate the page. It also handles the icon's active state and visited in the case of a link.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you didn't want to add a span with text inside your button or link, you could use the aria-label attribute to provide a text alternative.\r\n\r\nOne little tip. If you use an icon inside a link or button, do not leave whitespace between the outer wrapper element and the inner icon as you may get unwanted effects in the styling, such as underlined spaces either side of your icon. Keep it tight.",

    "post_content": "One of the things I've learned early on in web accessibility is the importance of colour contrast to make things easy to read on screen. High contrast is good but the size of text is also a factor. If it's larger it's easier to read even if the contrast drops.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, having very large text with high contrast is quite \"full on\". It can feel a bit like you're being shouted at. <em>Oppressive</em> is the word I'd use.\r\n\r\nThis got me thinking. I wonder if we can scale colour contrast with font size so that it always feels good. It's really an extension of responsive design.\r\n\r\nSo, I tried it in CodePen.\r\n\r\n[codepen_embed height=\"600\" theme_id=\"1248\" slug_hash=\"ajvVPL\" default_tab=\"result\" user=\"chris22smith\" editable=\"true\" data-editable=\"true\"]See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/ajvVPL/\">Font Size vs Color Contrast</a> by Chris Smith (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith\">@chris22smith</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nI've just done some very crude maths to make the RGB colour proportional to the font-size. As the font gets larger so do the RGB values, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's probably some beautiful golden formula for getting the optimum contrast at every size but I wouldn't really know how to go about finding these optimum settings. This experiment seems to prove that the general idea is sound though.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to play around with it, take it further and let me know how you get on.",

Like it's not really doing anything, a bit of a hack? You'd be dead right to think that.\r\n\r\nLinks are used like this all the time and there's really no need. The intended purpose of links is to point to another location and provide navigation. That's why the href is there. It's pointing to another place but it's often left pointing nowhere.\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth pointing out that using <code>href=\"#\"</code> doesn't actually do nothing. It adds a # onto your current location, changing the URL, so when you then click the back button it appears to do nothing but is actually going back to the last location, the URL without the #. If you do use <code>href=\"#\"</code> and an onclick event be sure to use <code>event.preventDefault()</code> with it to prevent this location change.\r\n\r\nLinks get used in this way mainly because we want the styling and the interactivity. Hovering a link gives visual cues - underline changes, cursor changes so it's easy for a user to see it's something they can interact with.\r\n\r\nSo, what's the alternative? If you're just performing an action, use a button. It has the visual cues. It doesn't have any hacky <code>href=\"#\"</code> nonsense. It can be styled however you wish if the default styling is too full-on. It can even be styled to look exactly like a link, though personally I think there's value in differentiating between navigation and actions.\r\n\r\nAnd there's more... You get some more benefits for free with a button.\r\n\r\nYou have a disabled property. You can easily make your action unavailable. Not so easy with a link.\r\n\r\nIt's more touch friendly. This depends on styling but out-of-the-box it's a larger touch target.\r\n\r\nIt has an autofocus property so it can be in focus on page load without needing any JavaScript. Ready to go at the tap of the Enter key.\r\n\r\nIf you use links for navigation and buttons for actions you get every tool doing what it's best at. You could cut your food with the side of your fork and raise it to your mouth on the side of your knife but why would you? This isn't really so different.",

    "post_content": "Google Analytics is brilliant at tracking things like Page Views for a website. It logs the URL and then keeps a count of how may times that URL is requested. Great, right? Not always.\r\n\r\nThere's a problem. Dynamic sites that use IDs in their URLs generate a lot of different URLs. A typical example might be a site being made up of list and details screens, so the URL for a list screen might end in <code>/List/</code>. For a details page there's probably one template with the data changing dynamically and the ID for that item is probably in the URL, something like <code>/Details/123</code> or <code>/Details?id=123</code>.\r\n\r\nThis means that Google Analytics sees every visit to a different item's details as a different screen. This is ideal for some data analysis, like seeing which item is viewed most but not so great when you want to look at something like the performance of that template. Having hundreds of different URLs makes it impossible to analyse the template as a single screen.\r\n\r\nGood news. It's quite easy to set up another view to show the aggregated data using filters.\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>Go to the Admin area and create a new view.</li>\r\n \t<li>Find Filters and add a new filter.</li>\r\n \t<li>Add a Filter Name.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select a Filter Type of Custom.</li>\r\n \t<li>Use the Search and Replace option.</li>\r\n \t<li>Select a Filter Field of Request URI.</li>\r\n \t<li>The Search String needs to match the ID. You can use regex to match any patterns so if you know your ID is 3-5 digits long you can use <code>[0-9]{3,5}</code>. If it varies you could use a wildcard, like <code>id=*</code>.</li>\r\n \t<li>Add a Replace String. I use something to represent what's being replaced, like ID. This gives me a URL like <code>/Details/ID</code> or <code>/Details?id=ID</code>. If you've used a wildcard in the Search String with part of the URL you can replace this too, like <code>id=ID</code>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nHere's an example of replacing a GUID in the URL:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-806\" title=\"Google Analytics Filtering screenshot\" src=\"http://chrissmith.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/replace-guid-filter.png\" alt=\"Google Analytics Filtering screenshot\" width=\"320\" height=\"456\" />The full regex needed is:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><code>[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}</code></p>\r\nAn added bonus. When you look at your reports in Google Analytics you'll no longer see URLs like <code>/Details/aace7226-0576-4a0f-9b39-bb549a53ee11</code> but just <code>/Details/GUID</code>. Much easier to understand, especially if your URL contains several IDs or GUIDs.\r\n\r\nHope this helps you analyse your screens, templates or UIs rather than just the data requested.",

    "post_content": "I thought it might be useful to share some of my not-so-great experiences as a freelance web designer so that others can learn from my mistakes.\r\n<h3>All Work and No Pay</h3>\r\nWhat's really frustrating is that I made the same mistake several times. That costly mistake was doing work and not getting paid for it. I'd get an enquiry for building a site by phone or email. I'd get straight back with some ideas and a quote and more often than not my quote would be accepted. I'd even have written confirmation that yes, they wanted to pay me for a website. On this basis I'd do the work and then when it came to sharing my design they'd say that they didn't want to go ahead any more or that they'd found another designer.\r\n\r\nIt's hard as a designer. You can get excited by a project. As soon as you finish speaking to the customer the ideas start flooding into your head and you want to capture that excitement and creativity there and then. Unfortunately, in my experience it often doesn't actually materialise. They're just not as serious about the project as you think they are.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to assume that it's just talk until you see some commitment, and by commitment I mean money. Ask for a deposit. It doesn't have to be much, even £10 or $10 will do, but it's just enough to prove that they're serious. Don't lift a finger until you've got a serious commitment. Trust me -you can't afford to work for nothing.\r\n<h3>The Price is Right</h3>\r\nThe other mistake I made was in my pricing. As I was fairly new to web design I thought I'd hit the low end of the market where I could compete on price and get lots of small cheap sites in my portfolio. It worked well for some customers but it's surprising how many people expect you to travel to see them at your expense when you're charging less than £100 for a website. The only way you can operate at the cheap end is by having very low outgoing costs.\r\n\r\nLater, when I stopped being a full-time freelancer and moved into a permanent job I kept the web design going as a side line. At this point I could afford to be more picky about which projects I took on, and, without needing to be so competitive I raised my prices. In fact, I doubled my prices. Here's the thing. I was expecting my number of enquiries to drop off. It didn't. It pretty much doubled. I think that going too cheap was actually suggesting low quality or making people suspicious. Charging more can suggest higher quality and strangely provide some reassurance.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be to find the price that you think your service is worth and then double it. Serious customers want to buy quality services and with something like a website they're looking for a long term relationship, not a quick handover.\r\n<h3>Losing Focus</h3>\r\nThe third mistake I made was spending my time on the wrong things. I spent a lot of time trying to market myself rather than focusing on client work. I put a lot of hours into studying Google Analytics, SEO and building other sites to promote my main business. It would have been far more cost effective to just pay for advertising rather than commit this time. Trying to market myself by spending time and not money was a false economy. Focus on what you're good at and pay others to do what they're good at.\r\n\r\nHope that helps someone.",

    "post_content": "I thought I'd share a way of writing your JavaScript that will make a tree view hierarchy render and respond very quickly.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the demo. I've got 100,000 items, quite a hefty data set, which is randomly generated in a function. You can change the number of items easily in the JS area. Click on the + or - icons to expand or collapse nodes.\r\n\r\n[codepen_embed height=\"520\" theme_id=\"dark\" slug_hash=\"WawYKX\" default_tab=\"result\" user=\"chris22smith\" editable=\"true\" data-editable=\"true\"]See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/WawYKX/\">Super Fast JavaScript Data Tree</a> by Chris Smith (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith\">@chris22smith</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nIt's still quick, like instant, with 100,000 items. It can start to slow a little at a million but I'd say it's still acceptable given that kind of data.\r\n<h3>One Long List</h3>\r\nThe trick is in how the data is structured. It's one big array, not hierarchical data with objects inside other objects. The reason for this is pretty simple, it's all about iterations or looping. If you have a single array you can run through the whole list of items once. If it's nested you have to get into loops inside other loops and it gets more complicated and takes longer. In fact, you'd be lucky for it to work at all without getting stack overflow errors.\r\n<h3>JavaScript Magic</h3>\r\nWith a single array you can use the built in JavaScript Array methods, which are very fast - <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">map()</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filter()</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some()</a>. I'd definitely recommend reading up on these. All three work in IE9+ so hopefully you shouldn't have to worry too much about browser support.\r\n\r\nI use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">map()</a> to convert each data item into a HTML list item which I can insert into the DOM. I use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filter()</a> to quickly find the children items of any item by returning a subset, and I use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some()</a> to see if an item has children. The beauty of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">some()</a> is that once its found it child it stops iterating, saving time.\r\n<h3>Easy on the DOM</h3>\r\nThe other part of this is keeping DOM manipulation to a minimum. Playing around with data in memory trivial for a browser but making changes to the DOM and rendering things on screen takes time. So, only the nodes that are needed right now exist in the DOM - there are not hidden items waiting on the sidelines. So, a new &lt;ul&gt; is added when you expand a node and the &lt;ul&gt; is removed when you collapse. A + icon is shown if the item has children of its own but we don't know anything about how many it has or what they contain until it's expanded.\r\n<h3>More...</h3>\r\nIf you found this useful it might be worth looking at my older post <a href=\"https://chrissmith.xyz/lightning-fast-filtering-in-javascript/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lightning Fast Filtering in JavaScript</a>, which uses a lot of the same principles.",

    "post_content": "I don't think I'm the first person to think this by any stretch. There are lots of infographics around showing the difference between web tooling now and 10 years ago and it's clearly ballooned at an extraordinary rate.\r\n\r\nIn the last year or so I've started working with Angular (as opposed to Angular.js a.k.a. Angular 1) and have also dabbled in Vue and React. All of these frameworks seem to share the same basic ideas - build everything as a component and push and pull them from the <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> as needed. Each component is made up of a HTML template, embedded CSS styles and a JavaScript controller.\r\n\r\nThis feels like an efficient way of working, very <abbr title=\"Don't Repeat Yourself\">DRY</abbr>. But is it? You create a component, let's say a time picker. One it's developed you can put it into multiple views or uses relatively quickly. However, if you later modify it to work slightly differently, using adding complexity, you have to test it in each use case and make sure it still works with no detrimental effects.\r\n\r\nAll <abbr title=\"User Interface\">UI</abbr>s are basically built up of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Traditionally HTML is for content, CSS for styling and JavaScript for reacting to user behaviour. With components we're adding a whole load of JavaScript just to make the basic elements appear before we even get into any behavioural usage. This adds to page weight (size of files being transferred to the browser) and render times. There's the library itself, often split into many smaller modules, plus a controller for the UI to assemble it and then the components. It could just be one HTML file, one CSS file and one JavaScript file.\r\n\r\nIncreasingly, what the developer writes in their editor is becoming further and further from what actually appears in the <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr>. The frameworks insert a whole host of IDs and classes to elements, bloating the HTML and making it harder to read. Styles are inserted as inline &lt;style&gt; blocks rather than being cached in an external stylesheet. Opening the browser's Dev Tools to track down and fix a problem is becoming harder, not easier.\r\n\r\nAlso, the more tools you use, the more you've got to maintain, keep up to date, upgrade and replace. It's creating work just to keep up and inviting technical debt.\r\n\r\nI think that what we're gaining in terms of being able to develop new UI more quickly is all rooted in developer efficiency and production cost saving. It's not thinking about the user. We're making things slower for users. The mobile experience on most sites is still awful and the overhead of these frameworks is partly to blame.\r\n\r\nThe latest frameworks also rely on good browsers with all the JavaScript features. They do not use progressive enhancement but just grind to a halt on an older browser. This goes against the universal nature of the web - it should be easy to read and easy to write. The bells and whistles on the top is just that and should be optional, not prevent the basics from working.\r\n\r\nI think we need to get back to making things simple. Write HTML, CSS and as little JavaScript as we can get away with. Go static wherever possible. Make it fast and simple for users. User experience should trump developer experience.",

    "post_content": "I think we all know that having a smaller DOM is good for performance but I was never sure what's considered big or small, or at what points performance is affected. Knowing a little more can change how you approach things.\r\n\r\nI was recently doing a performance analysis on some pages and the tool I chose to use was the Chrome Performance Audit. If you open Dev Tools (F12) and go to the Audits tab you'll see a range of available audits which includes Performance. This uses a tool called Lighthouse and gives estimates for various performance metrics as well as Opportunities and Diagnostics.\r\n\r\nOne of the diagnostics which came up for me was \"<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/dom-size\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Uses an excessive DOM size</a>\" and the detail gives us this:\r\n<blockquote>Browser engineers recommend pages contain fewer than ~1,500 DOM nodes. The sweet spot is a tree depth &lt; 32 elements and fewer than 60 children/parent element. A large DOM can increase memory usage, cause longer <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">style calculations</a>, and produce costly <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/speed/articles/reflow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">layout reflows</a>.</blockquote>\r\nThe item that triggered this diagnostic for me was a year picker, a select element with 150 options. Whilst I don't think it's really causing any major performance issues it did strike me that 1 parent element and 150 children does seem excessive for just picking out one number from a consecutive range so I started looking at alternative ways we could do this. I wanted to put my year picker on a  \"DOM Diet\". I created this pen:\r\n\r\n[codepen_embed height=\"520\" theme_id=\"dark\" slug_hash=\"MzJrjL\" default_tab=\"result\" user=\"chris22smith\" editable=\"true\" data-editable=\"true\"]See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith/pen/MzJrjL/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Year Pickers</a> by Chris Smith (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/chris22smith\">@chris22smith</a>) on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CodePen</a>.[/codepen_embed]\r\n\r\nHere's a quick comparison of 4 possible ways of selecting a year from a consecutive range. It's important to not only look at possible DOM performance but also the user experience side - ease of understanding and ease of use. No point making it faster if it's confusing or hard work.\r\n<h3>Select/Dropdown</h3>\r\nThis is the standard method. It can have a default value or a blank value as the first option. It's very familiar, ease to understand and use. It's probably better to start with a blank value so that we know a user has actually made a selection rather than just left the default. It supports arrow keys and mousewheel. It's easy to validate using just the required property as the available options are set. It can look untidy in some browsers when long option lists run off the bottom of the screen and it does use a lot of DOM nodes.\r\n<h3>Range Input</h3>\r\nThe input[type=range] doesn't show a value by default so you have to do a bit of work to show an output value, and a bit more work to do this elegantly. Through testing I found the output value had to go above the slider rather than below so it was not obscured by a finger using the control. I think this is fairly easy to understand but users may not be aware that they can use their arrow keys to get greater precision - either up/down or left/right. It can be hard to control and get the exact figure you want dragging the handle especially using a finger. It can also be wired up to support the wheel event and respond to scrolling up or down on the mousewheel. There's no way to have a blank value so it has to have a default set. There's no real validation to be done as it has to use a value in the range. It's very kind to the DOM too with only 3 nodes.\r\n<h3>Number Input</h3>\r\nThis method is very simple. You just let the user type in the date they want. It can be left blank or have a default value. It can be controlled using arrow keys or the mousewheel though I'm not sure how many users know this. By setting the min, max and step attributes it can limit the range entered when not typing. If the value is typed (or pasted) it will require validation. This uses a single DOM node.\r\n<h3>Multiple Number Inputs</h3>\r\nThis final method is just a bit of a \"left field\" design. The advantage of it is that it's very easy to update using the tab key and arrow keys. By having the digits separated the range for each is only ever 10 so in theory it should mean less to change. If left blank it could be set to automatically shift the focus to the next input when a value is added. This makes it as fast to type the 4 digits as a single number input. The min, max and step attributes can limit the range for each digit. It's light on the DOM too with only 5 nodes. The disadvantage with this method is the validation - it's going to be a bit more involved, parsing the 4 digits as a single value to be checked and then highlighting the invalid digit(s) could be difficult. On a mobile device with a number pad it also means the pad flashing in and out quickly, which is not a great experience so it's only really suitable for desktop use.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd necessarily go running from the standard dropdown but some of the other methods are certainly possibilities and help keep the DOM smaller.",

I've built a base system which loads HTML pages and then created a HTML page for each design element.

And, by contrast, the most common method seems to be to use the CSS \"display:none\". Probably no great surprise to anyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think it's interesting to think about what we're really doing when we hide an element. Is the visibility of the element just for screen users or for all users? Do we still want the element available for non visual media?

Does it need to be in the DOM at all or are we just keeping it there because it's easier?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we use JavaScript, either native or a framework, we can insert and remove elements as needed based on logic.

It is stating that this element is not to be considered when reading the document, whether that be on screen or via assistive technologies.

It is more about the state of the element and closer in meaning to the input[type=hidden] that we used to see in the days before Ajax.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you take away the JavaScript and CSS - maybe some network issues, maybe the HTML gets copied elsewhere - the element stays hidden.

There are a few important parameters for how I use Twitter, which may explain differences from what you see. Firstly, I don't exclusively follow people in tech. I follow real world friends, football journalists, comedians, celebrities - a pretty broad spectrum of people. Here I've limited the tweets analysed to just those from people in tech. I've got to admit there were one or two where I wasn't sure so had to check their bios. Secondly, I try to follow real people, not faceless organisations. My rationale is that organisations' tweets are 99% self-promotion. If their content is good enough I'll get to hear about it via others retweeting. I'm trusting the people I follow to filter the organisational information I receive. Final point is I have a couple of words muted - \"Trump\" and \"Brexit\". This will obviously impact on the amount of political tweets I see.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, here's a breakdown from <strong>100</strong> tweets on Friday 26th April, roughly 5.00 - 5.30pm UK time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>68%</strong> were tech-related<br><strong>29%</strong> were not tech-related<br><strong>3%</strong> I couldn't be sure about</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>6%</strong> I could not understand, tech or otherwise</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of the <strong>68</strong> tech related tweets,<br><strong>48 (71%)</strong> were aiming to share something useful<br>(retweets, links to resources, media)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of the <strong>29 </strong>tweets not related to tech, subjects/themes were:<br><strong>4</strong> Gender Inequality * <br><strong>2</strong> Humorous (jokes/memes) <br><strong>2</strong> Politics **<br><strong>2</strong> Cats<br><strong>1</strong> Dog<br><strong>1</strong> Goats<br><strong>1</strong> Game of Thrones<br><strong>1</strong> Mental Health ***</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>* It could be argued that these are tech related if the people tweeting are in the tech industry but it wasn't mentioned explicitly.

Microsoft Edge is moving from using the EdgeHTML engine to open source Chromium, which will bring it in line with Chrome, Opera and Safari. That's nice for compatibility but the big deal is that it will be available on older Windows operating systems. Up until now Edge was only available on Windows 10 but it will soon be available on 7, 8 and 8.1 too so more users can drop IE and use Edge as their official Microsoft browser.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Edge team are going one better than that though. One of the big reasons for clinging on to IE is the use of legacy software which only works on that browser. Edge is introducing an IE11 mode, so users can seamlessly (hmm - I can already hear the massive crash) switch over to IE for specific sites. Very clever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It looks like we might have a way out of IE11 support in the next 12 months or so.

The good ones give you lots of documentation making them pretty straightforward to implement and use. You load a script from a URL or local resource, use their methods and properties in your code and away you go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what if you then want to switch to another API provider? Maybe the one you were using isn't accessible, doesn't support the older browsers you need? Maybe they put their prices up? Whatever the reason you may need to switch at some point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This change means rewriting your app's JavaScript to work with the new API. You'll have to find every point it touches and update it. What if it works differently? What if this one takes an object parameter rather than an array? You'll have to completely rewrite the data parts too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a better way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Rather than working directly with an API and using the properties and methods in your code, you create an intermediary, your own internal service, which handles this functionality. The internal service maps the properties and methods you need to those of the third party API. It handles any data transformation needed. Your app works with this service, your own API, so that when a change of service provider is needed the app itself does not need to be rewritten, just the internal service.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An internal service can also be set up to work with multiple APIs at once so it maps everything it needs for each. This allows you to push choice to your users. So, for example, if it's a news, sport or weather feed built into a site, you can let your user choice their preferred information source. You could use different services for different regions, e.g. local news.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To use a slightly inappropriate analogy, it's better to be dating these APIs than to move in with them. &#x1f609;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

These are little things that work for me - they may not be for everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Get Showered and Dressed</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It sounds obvious but don't slouch around in your pyjamas. You need to make a work day different from the weekend and any little things you can do to create this clear separation will help your work-life balance and ensure you're in the right mindset, both ways.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Set Start and End Times</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't try to be too flexible with your hours. Stick to a normal working day. Don't slack off and think you can catch up later in your own time, and don't do extra to overcompensate for being at home. You need clear times when work stops and home life starts. It's very easy to get sucked in to \"just finishing off this bit\" and still be working hours later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Find Multiple Locations to Work</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're working from home for several consecutive days it can help to vary where you work. I wouldn't keep moving in one day but maybe start every third day in a new spot. For some people having a fixed work space within their home helps the separation so if this works for you, great.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Finding a Good Work Space</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For me it's important to be near a window. I actually work sitting in a bay window looking out onto my street. This naturally makes me look up from my screen from time to time as people pass by. My sleepy town isn't interesting enough for this to become a distraction but I appreciate this may not work somewhere busier. I would avoid spaces with no natural light, like lofts or basements. They're just not good for your state of mind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Lunch</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Set a start and end time for lunch as you would in an office environment. If you don't, you risk not finding time at all, not taking a break or the day becomes one continuous snack-fest, which is not going to end well over a sustained period of time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Managing Costs</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're home alone, do you really want to be heating your whole house? Or, if you're lucky enough to be somewhere warmer, using air-con? I try to stick to being in one room, close the door and use a portable heater. This saves a small fortune on my heating bill.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Think about the money you're saving on travel and put it aside for something which improves your home working lifestyle - a comfy office chair, a desk fan, a fancy microphone, a coffee machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Balancing Non-work Activity</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Working from home does bring some advantages. You can have goods delivered. You can have the washing machine or dishwasher going. My tip would be to not worry about the small things like answering the door, putting a load of washing on - things that take a trivial amount of time. You should avoid the tasks that take longer and can be left until after work - online shopping, folding washing, cooking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Distractions</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You're at work. You can ignore the door. You can ignore your phone. Don't use social media, unless it's work related.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Don't Get Isolated</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're alone for a period of time it's easy to start to feel isolated. When working from home you need to make extra effort to communicate with colleagues. Try to make the effort to actually talk to people rather than just using email or messaging services like Slack. You won't run into colleagues in communal areas, like the office water cooler or kitchen, so, if a few of you are working remotely you may need to create your own virtual spaces where non work related chat can happen to stay connected on a human level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What Works for You?</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone's different so do what works for you and if you have any good tips of your own please share.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I'm thinking specifically of scenarios which take the form \"if this, then that\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are media queries which will let us control the appearance of elements based on a variety of factors. Probably the most common is screen width, so we get things like \"if the width is 1024px or higher, then show an extra element\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are pseudo selectors like :empty, :checked, :valid, :disabled which let us control appearance based on state, giving us, for example, \"if the parent element has no children (:empty), then change its opacity\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We can also do logic based on combinations of elements or selectors, like li + li, for example, \"if the list item follows another list item, then give it a top border.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm sure there are plenty more ways of applying logic but you get the idea. Each of these is equivalent to writing a conditional statement in a programming language - if this, then that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The big question is, should we be doing this in CSS, and is there a point at which it becomes too difficult to manage in CSS and we need to defer to another technology, like JavaScript?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>My Experience</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started thinking about this when I was designing a UI with a lot of logic going on. We had a busy table where we show some additional columns at wider screen resolutions. At smaller widths the user would be able to toggle between different groups of columns and save a preference. But then these additional columns are only offered if they contain data. So, we had logic around the screen width, user preference and presence of data, which, multiplied out, meant 8 permutations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I initially tried to do it all with CSS. I set up media queries for the narrower and wider screen widths. Within each of these I then read a class for the user preference and then I used :empty to see if table cells contained any data. I managed it and it worked. Just.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, I realised that it was really not scalable. Every time I added a new condition it doubled the amount of CSS I was having to write. If we wanted to add more logic in future it would create more and more work and be harder and harder to maintain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By moving all the logic into JavaScript we can set simpler classes, one for each type of display we need rather than every permutation of logic. So now we just have 3 classes: 1) show the first set of columns, 2) show the second set or 3) show all columns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We still have lots of branches in our JavaScript but the big difference is that it's easy to read and follow. It's also easy to edit or extend if we ever need to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think doing some logic with CSS is fine but as soon as you're starting to layer it on and find yourself multiplying out the selectors you're writing it's probably time to move it over to JavaScript.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I'd definitely recommend to any new developers is to have your own blog. It's also a view I've seen shared by a lot of experienced developers. But why?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>How I Started</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've had this WordPress blog up and running since summer 2008. I know. A long time. I had a small static website for about 5 years before that. For me it came out of necessity. I was doing freelance web design so needed somewhere to promote my services and showcase what I could do. I started writing articles as a way of creating fresh content in order to climb the search engine results listings. This certainly did not have an instant impact but over a long time I think it did make a difference.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I started writing articles I knew that nobody would be reading them. I'm a realist and accepted that from day one. I was writing for myself. I still see it this way. It's for me and if it helps someone else, that's a bonus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I learn something interesting that I think is worth holding onto I write about it. It's a good way of helping to commit it to memory as well as creating an easy to find reference point to come back to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With anything of a technical nature, putting it into your own words and using your own mental models really helps you to fully understand it. It's a bit like the idea of learning by teaching. If you've ever done a presentation you'll know that the preparation you do really helps strengthen your own knowledge of the subject.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Your Journey</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A bit like keeping a diary having your own blog will let you see where you were a year ago, 5 years ago, ten years ago, or more. It's like a record of your own journey within the technology and the industry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Show and Tell</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, in my opinion, these are not the best reasons for having a blog. I think that the best reason is having something to show for your time. By putting in some time to write, little and often, over time you build up a nice collection of your thoughts, ideas and opinions. You have evidence of what you're into and what you spend time thinking about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Put yourself in an interview situation, going for your dream developer job. You can show your blog and right there you have strong evidence that you are passionate about the subject and that you willingly invest time and effort in it. That has to count for a lot. It shows more commitment and serious intent than social media activity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Writing Tips</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don't have to be good at writing. Even the best writers improve over time.  Keep going and you'll find your way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't beat yourself up if you haven't written for a while. Just do it as and when you want to. Don't force it and write about something you're not that bothered about just to get content.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, don't feel it has to be long form and 1000 words every time. It's fine to just share an idea in a few sentences.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Self Hosting</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another recommendation with writing a blog is to host your own site so that you retain 100% ownership of your content. There are numerous tech blogging platforms (e.g. medium, dev.to) but owning your own content and having any traffic surges benefiting you rather than the platform is definitely worth it long term.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you do use a third party platform check out the export options. Can you get all your content out and move it elsewhere? It's good to be free to do what you want with your work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>WordPress</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are lots of blogging platforms and software options out there. Personally I've always found WordPress is the best fit for my needs. The fact that it has native apps means that if I'm out and about and suddenly have a great idea for a post I can capture a quick draft there and then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's also very easy to export and import your data, meaning you can shift content from an old blog to a new one, combine or separate blogs, and move between hosted (.com) and self-hosted (.org) versions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The control over the design and ability to switch themes easily means you can keep your site fresh without having to worry about rewriting the content - there's a perfect separation between content and presentation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

It's just not realistic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Need for Speed</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the real world of web or software development, speed of development is key. We have to deliver functionality by deadlines. This might be because users need it for a fixed date, or maybe you need to move quickly to make the most of a gap in the market, or you need to beat your competitors or keep pace with them - there are many reasons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let's say we're adding a new feature to search and filter product data. We've estimated that the full feature will take 4 weeks. However, we can deliver a very basic search box that just matches all product text within a week. We can actually deliver about three quarters of the value to the end user in one quarter of the time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The need for speed means that we can't take our time and build the perfect solution.

Maybe after the first release we realise that this is all they need and we don't need to build the rest? Maybe it's too slow in the real world and we need to go back and improve this before adding more complexity? Maybe the known bugs are not quite what we thought they were?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is general agile development, starting simple and building in iterations, and is largely about good planning and communication.

It has thrown up some interesting challenges which I felt were worth sharing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I first saw the requirement I thought it would be simple - progress is just number of questions divided by number of answers, easy maths, right? Well, it could be in a very simple questionnaire but ours threw up a few more curved balls. Here are some additional considerations:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some questions are mandatory, others are optional, so are we counting all questions or only the mandatory ones?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is some conditional logic so a question may be shown or hidden depending on how you answer another question. How do we handle that?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some questions can have multiple answers, like a checkbox list, so how many do we count?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some answers may automatically answer other questions. I know this sounds odd but it's a big old questionnaire and sometimes it was useful to repeat some questions and answers in a different context in case it changed the answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our architecture has questions and answers as 2 separate API calls, which each bring back object arrays. Questions and answers are linked by a common data point, which is just an identifier so that we can match them up. So, time to work through our extra considerations...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We only want to count mandatory questions. These are denoted by an isRequired property on each question so we can filter to that like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const filteredQuestions = questions.filter(q =&gt; q.isRequired);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also only want to count questions that are shown. We can't reasonably expect a user to answer a question they haven't seen. This is similar to the isRequired property but using isVisible, so to filter on both of these (instead of just the one property above) we can do this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const filteredQuestions = questions.filter(q =&gt; q.isRequired &amp;&amp; q.isVisible);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If questions have multiple answers, it doesn't matter, we're just interested in whether or not they have an answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next we need to deal with duplicated questions and/or answers. We can convert our filtered questions and our answers into arrays of unique data points. First we simplify the array to only hold the data point string, then we dedupe it by converting the array to a set and back again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const questionDataPoints = questions.map(q =&gt; q.dataPoint);\nconst uniqueQuestionDataPoints = &#91;...new Set(questionDataPoints)];\n\nconst answerDataPoints = answers.map(a =&gt; a.dataPoint);\nconst uniqueAnswerDataPoints = &#91;...new Set(answerDataPoints)];</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that we've got a list of unique question data points and a list of unique answer data points we only need to see which of our questions have answers, which we can do like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const numberOfQuestions = uniqueQuestionDataPoints.length;\nconst questionsAnswered = uniqueQuestionDataPoints.filter(q =&gt; uniqueAnswerDataPoints.includes(q));\nconst numberOfAnswers = questionsAnswered.length;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These figures can now be used as our value and max attributes or numerator and denominator in a fraction. To give a percentage we can do this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const percentage = Math.round((numberOfAnswers/numberOfQuestions) * 100);</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If we want a normalised figure, a decimal in the range between 0 and 1, we can stick with the simpler fraction calculation like this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const normalized = numberOfAnswers/numberOfQuestions;</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The &lt;progress&gt; HTML element can take max and value attributes or if we don't specify a max we can simply pass a normalised value.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I started out with doing web stuff in 1999, things were very different, much simpler in some ways but much harder in others. So, the way I gradually learnt was quite different from how somebody would learn now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Back in my day...</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don't yawn, there is a point to this. In 1999 when I started learning this stuff, there was only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No TypeScript, no Sass, no real frameworks to speak of, no packages, no build tools. You get the picture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, there was a lot less to learn but learning was harder. There wasn't great documentation online, or, at least, not easy to find, so I used books. Cross browser compatibility was hard.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In short, it's a completely different landscape now. So, I thought it would be interesting to think about how I would learn or advise others to learn if starting out now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The basics</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The basics are still the basics. <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> are the technologies used by web browsers. That hasn't changed in all this time and it's not likely to change any time soon. While trends will come and go a good understanding of these three areas will always be time well spent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a critical area that is often overlooked. The web is a universal platform that should be for everyone, not just for those with good eyesight, expensive devices and fast networks. We need to consider how we deliver content that works for all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's definitely worth learning this from the beginning so things are done in the right way as it's harder to correct bad habits later. Being able to demonstrate an understanding of accessibility will put you ahead of other candidates who have skipped over it when it comes to job hunting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Go deep</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going further, I'd say it's worth exploring these HTML, CSS and JavaScript in some depth before moving on. I think it's worth skimming through everything on them at pace without worrying about retaining too much. This could be either a course or just working through documentation. Just becoming familiar with what features there are and some terminology will help you understand more conversations and documentation, as well as know what to search for when the time comes to use them. Nobody can remember it all and even experienced developers have to look up syntax. That's not generally what an employer would expect, it's more about the broad understanding of how you can use features to solve problems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Responsive design</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's rare these days that we can create a web page that will be for a single screen size, so we need to know how to make a user interface that looks good on a big desktop screen and a phone. This is a whole area that is again worth tackling fairly early on. It's a bit of an art, a collection of techniques and tricks that are not easy to discover. This is an area that would probably benefit from a course.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Source control and package management</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you've got enough of the basics to make something amazing, you'll naturally want to share it with the world, and then you'll want to make use of your amazing thing or other people's in your future projects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Source control is about publishing code but also collaboration - reviewing each other's code, branching out and merging it back together. The most commonly used system for this is probably <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">git</a>. Worth reading up on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Package management is about bundling up your project into a package that can be easily exported and then imported into other projects. The most common platform for front end code is <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" title=\"npm\">npm</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These two areas usually involve using the command line, a terminal where you type commands to make things happen. It's not as scary as it looks and makes you look like a proper hacker to those not in the know.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Frameworks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Probably later than some would expect, but I genuinely feel the other things are more important to get good longer term. If you learn a <a href=\"https://chrissmith.xyz/when-to-reach-for-a-framework-and-when-not-to/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">framework</a> too early their way of doing things becomes your normal and then if you change framework you have to start again. If you understand the core technologies then you can see what the framework is giving you and can adjust more easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://chrissmith.xyz/why-its-still-worth-learning-bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS frameworks</a> can be very useful for providing ready-made styling, bringing consistency and the CSS is well structured. It's a good way of learning how to structure your own CSS for larger projects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>JavaScript frameworks like <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Vue</a> or <a href=\"https://angular.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Angular</a> take some investment to learn but it is paid off in terms of faster development down the line.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are also UI frameworks and design systems which provide complete components ready to use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all of these frameworks, there's lots of time saving and knowledge to be gained but it's important to remember that these are just someone's opinion and one way of doing things. There is no single right way or best way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Extending the basics with pre-compilation</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'd say that's probably everything you <em>need</em> but there are a couple of other bits that are cheap to learn so worth throwing in there - more skills to boast about can't hurt.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sass</a> is a superset of CSS - it's CSS with added bells and whistles. You write in .scss files, making use of the fancy additional features and then it gets compiled to normal CSS. The great part is that it's additional features, not a different language so CSS is valid Sass. You can start out with a .scss file, just write normal CSS and it gets compiled to CSS. It's a bit pointless but means you can start off with nothing and then gradually learn and use Sass one feature at a time. It's a nice easy learning curve.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's the same idea with <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TypeScript</a>. This is enhanced JavaScript so you can write in .ts files and get JavaScript, learning the new features as you go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With both of these, once you get into the new features you'll never go back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Then, anything goes</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you've got these skills, it's really an open playing field. You can learn whatever takes your interest, or maybe whatever your job needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let me know if you'd do things differently.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
